The fascinating text - written by Dr. William H. Gerdts, the preeminent scholar in the field - is the definitive study of the subject, filled with many years of far-ranging research. Documentary photographs of the artists and quotations from their private letters and journals complement the text and provide a vivid sense of their lives and times.</p><p>This exquisitely produced volume contains masterpieces by artists such as John Singer Sargent, William Merritt Chase, and Helen Turner. The paintings, reproduced in full color, are accompanied by text exploring the genesis of American impressionist painting. William H. Gerdts examines the relationship of American impressionism to French impressionism, and then follows the Americans as they developed distinctive regional styles. Gerdts covers some of these stylistic approaches in depth, including the Pennsylvania and Midwestern schools, and pays close attention to 10 different painters and their work. The words and the images in this tiny book combine to give readers a grand view of American impressionism.<b>William H. Gerdts</b> is professor emeritus of art history at the Graduate Center, City University of New York.<br></p><h2>The Last Battle of Winchester: Phil Sheridan, Jubal Early, and the Shenandoah Valley Campaign, August 7 - September 19, 1864</h2><p>The Last Battle of Winchester is the first serious study to chronicle the largest, longest, and bloodiest battle fought in the Shenandoah Valley. The fighting began about daylight and did not end until dusk, when the victorious Union army routed the Confederates off the field. It was the first time Stonewall Jackson&#x2019;s former corps had ever been driven from a battlefield, and the stinging defeat set the stage for the final climax of the 1864 Valley Campaign at Fisher&#x2019;s Hill and Cedar Creek. The Northern victory was a long time coming.<br><br>After a spring and summer of Union defeat in the Valley, Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant cobbled together a formidable force under redoubtable cavalryman Phil Sheridan. His task was a tall one: sweep Jubal Early&#x2019;s Confederate army out of the bountiful Shenandoah and reduce the verdant region of its supplies. Thus far, the aggressive Early had led Jackson&#x2019;s veterans to one victory after another at Lynchburg, Monocacy, Snickers Gap, and Kernstown.<br><br>Author Scott Patchan, recognized as the foremost authority on the 1864 Valley Campaign, dissects the five weeks of complex maneuvering and sporadic combat before the opposing armies ended up at Winchester, an important town in the northern end of the Valley that had changed hands dozens of times during the war. Tactical brilliance and ineptitude were on display throughout the day-long affair as Sheridan threw infantry and cavalry against the thinning Confederate ranks, and Early and his generals shifted to meet each assault. A final blow against Early&#x2019;s left flank collapsed the Southern army, killed one of the Confederacy&#x2019;s finest combat generals in Robert Rodes, and planted the seeds of the sweeping largescale victory at Cedar Creek the following month. <br><br>Patchan&#x2019;s vivid prose is based upon more than two decades of meticulous firsthand research and an unparalleled understanding of the battlefield. Nearly two dozen original maps, scores of photos, hundreds of explanatory footnotes, and seven invaluable appendices enhance our understanding of this watershed battle. Rich in analysis and dramatic character development, The Last Battle of Winchester is certain to become a classic Civil War battle study.<br><br>About the Author: A life-long student of military history, Scott C. Patchan is a graduate of James Madison University in the Shenandoah Valley. He is the author of many articles and books, including The Forgotten Fury: The Battle of Piedmont (1996), Shenandoah Summer: The 1864 Valley Campaign (2007), and Second Manassas: Longstreet&#x2019;s Attack and the Struggle for Chinn Ridge (2011). Patchan serves as a director on the board of the Kernstown Battlefield Association in Winchester, Virginia, and is a member of the Shenandoah Valley Battlefield Foundation&#x2019;s Resource Protection Committee.</p><p>A life-long student of military history, Scott C.

Patchan serves as a Director on the board of the Kernstown Battlefield Association in Winchester, Virginia, and is a member of the Shenandoah Valley Battlefield Foundation&#x2019;s Resource Protection Committee.&#x201c;The Last Battle of Winchester is the most detailed analysis yet of this third and final crucial battle in the Shenandoah Valley, and should stand as the definitive work on the subject. Scott Patchan, as he always does, brings his unique insight, good storytelling skills, deep research, and keen appreciation for the terrain together in one outstanding work of history.&#x201d; (Eric J. Wittenberg, award-winning Civil War author of Gettysburg&#x2019;s Forgotten Cavalry Actions)<br><br>&#x201c;Scott Patchan&#x2019;s The Last Battle of Winchester is a masterpiece in Civil War campaign studies. Indeed, it is a thrilling read. Nothing that has come before it approaches this level of artistry. Unequaled research in primary sources provides the foundation for the extensive coverage of every operation leading up to and including the bloodiest battle ever fought in Virginia&#x2019;s Shenandoah Valley. If you read one Civil War book this year, this blockbuster must be it.&#x201d; (Theodore C. Mahr, former National Park Historian, Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National Military Park, and author of the acclaimed The Battle of Cedar Creek: Showdown in the Shenandoah)<br><br>&#x201c;Fast-paced, comprehensive, and vividly written, The Last Battle of Winchester is a must-read for anyone interested in the 1864 Valley Campaign.&#x201d; (Scott L. Mingus Sr., author of Flames Beyond Gettysburg and Confederate General William &#x201c;Extra Billy&#x201d; Smith)<br><br>&#x201c;Few communities in the Civil War found themselves fought over as much as Winchester, Virginia, which changed hands dozens of times. The last time was thanks to the dramatic battle of Winchester in September 1864, when Philip Sheridan and Jubal Early began their immortal Valley campaign. No battle fought in the Shenandoah has received the kind of exhaustive treatment that Scott Patchan brings to The Last Battle of Winchester, in what must instantly become the definitive work on the subject. Combining exhaustive research and skillful analysis, Patchan presents in vivid prose the story of the beginning of the end of Confederate control of that fabled Valley.&#x201d; (William C. Davis, Virginia Center for Civil War Studies, Virginia Tech)<br><br>&#x201c;This is a masterful recounting of the first major battle between Jubal Early and Phil Sheridan in the 1864 Shenandoah Valley Campaign, and Scott Patchan brings the combat of the 19th of September vividly to life through years of research and the use of previously untapped materials.&#x201d; (Charlie Knight, author of Valley Thunder: The Battle of New Market)</p><h2>Diana: The Portrait</h2><p>Supplemented by many never before published photographs, offers a personal look at the woman known for her humanitarian inspiration to the world.</p><p>Rosalind Coward is the author of numerous books, including Sacred Cows, Female Desire, The Whole Truth, and Our Treacherous Hearts. A freelance writer, she pens a popular weekly column for the UK&#39;s daily newspaper The Guardian.PQ Publishers Ltd. is a privately owned publisher and licensing company based in New Zealand. PQ is dedicated to the development of large-scale illustrated book projects and associated brands.The tributes to the life and career of Lady Diana continue with this lavish production, authorized by her estate and Memorial Fund. Coming as it does with that seal of approval, it should be no surprise to readers that this large, glossy book is tasteful and keenly decorous. It&#x2019;s also rich with photos from just about every one of Diana&#x2019;s 36 years. Many images and testimonies will be familiar to her fans but some&#x2014;&#x2014;particularly the ones depicting her early years dancing and swimming, attending boarding school and working at her first job&#x2014;have never been published. Unfortunately, Coward doesn&#x2019;t pair the pictures with captions, so if one isn&#x2019;t familiar with every detail of Princess Diana&#x2019;s history, it can be frustrating to try to decipher what the images show. The text relies primarily on interviews with those who knew (or even briefly encountered) the princess, from photographers to lawyers, fashion designers to fellow aid workers. Predictably, they all speak reverentially of her, but the extensive quotations set the book apart from many Diana biographies and show just how far her influence extended ("All the landmine stuff was jolly brave," says Sandy Gall of Afghanistan Appeal; "She made me more nervous than many military opponents," reflects Colin Powell, who led her to the dance floor at a charity gala for cancer). Coward is careful to show numerous facets of her subject, though the theme of Diana&#x2019;s extensive humanitarian work dominates, while difficulties in her personal life are downplayed. If at times overly worshipful, the book is nonetheless a lovely compilation and a fitting continuation of Diana&#x2019;s legacy, as the book&#x2019;s net royalties will be donated to projects supported by her Memorial Fund.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

A brick crumbles from a windowsill overhead, striking her unconscious, and she is immediately rushed to the hospital. But although it begins with this event and with the anguish Jayson and his wife, Stacy, confront in the wake of their daughter's trauma and the hours leading up to her death, <i>Once More We Saw Stars</i> quickly becomes a narrative that is as much about hope and healing as it is about grief and loss. Jayson recognizes, even in the midst of his ordeal, that there will be a life for him beyond it--that if only he can continue moving forward, from one moment to the next, he will survive what seems unsurvivable. With raw honesty, deep emotion, and exquisite tenderness, he captures both the fragility of life and absoluteness of death, and most important of all, the unconquerable power of love. This is an unforgettable memoir of courage and transformation--and a book that will change the way you look at the world.</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of May 2019:</strong> There&#x2019;s a moment early in <em>Once More We Saw Stars</em> when Jayson Greene&#x2019;s 2-year-old daughter, Greta, is in the hospital, hovering between life and death but slipping towards the latter, and &#x201c;we glance around us, realizing this is the last we&#x2019;ll ever see of the world as we&#x2019;ve known it. Whatever comes next will raze everything to the ground.&#x201d; That sentence illustrates how difficult it is to read this memoir without a lump in one&#x2019;s throat. In the hierarchy of death, the death of a child is the worst, the one that makes people recoil. Those who experience such a trauma frequently talk about moving through a fog of grief, unable to recall the particulars of the days and weeks after the death, memories and heartstrings cauterized by the searing pain of loss. How amazing, then, that Greene <em>can</em> recall those particulars: the pain, the grief, the fears that their little family will never again experience joy, and the worry that his marriage cannot survive such loss. And that even in the midst of trauma he knows he and his wife have the tools and the traits to get out the other side, to refashion their broken life into one where they can laugh again. How they keep their eyes on that prize is what makes this memoir a heartbreaking but reassuring look at courage, resilience, our slim hold on life, and the bonds of family that make life precious. <em>&#x2014;Vannessa Cronin</em>JAYSON GREENE is a contributing writer and former senior editor at Pitchfork.

It's a cultural history of the cold war, a psychoanalysis of the military, and an unswerving look at our fascination for UFOs. What happened at Roswell in the 1940s? What is the Air Force doing out at Area 51? Whether you join the "youfers," and decide that genuine aliens are here, doing their inexplicable thing, or the "Interceptors," who desperately seek sightings of stealth planes, or "black aircraft," you'll need to camp at the perimeters of the vast desert wildernesses set aside for secrecy to do your research. Patton explores the edges (and sometimes the insides) of these strange, lonely places in the same way he examines the psyches and motives of the people who inhabit them--with bemused semiobjectivity. Patton seems to be saying that human weirdness is roomy enough to encompass everything, from UFOs to top-secret military planes to global atomic destruction. He writes of Dreamland: "I came to believe that its legend and lore, its language and paradoxes, provided a strange and yet appropriate time capsule of a half century of cold war and black secrecy. Here, the cultures of nuclear power and airpower merged with the folklores of extraterrestrials and earthly conspiracies; their interference patterns formed a moir� of the weird. It was a place from which to see our own planet with the eyes of an outsider." <i>--Therese Littleton</i>Acclaim for Dreamland<br><br>"A mind-opening tale of trespass and revelation, of road adventures, technothriller hardware, saucer folks, and aerospace outlaws--as well as daring account of our history through the Cold War and beyond by what we have seen, and often wish we had not seen, in the hazardous dreamscape of the American sky." --THOMAS PYNCHON<br><br></p><h2>Fragile</h2><p>Six years after trading in his combat gear for hospital scrubs, Luke still hasn&#39;t found what he&#39;s been searching for; a normal life. At work, Luke is faced with things just as heartbreaking as those on the battlefield, none more so than the abused children brought in by a pretty red-headed social worker. For Devon, being a social worker is a rewarding job, but also a constant reminder of her own troubled youth. Devon takes everything one day at a time, unable to form a relationship with anyone except the children she rescues.

The solution? Sara asks Nick Montrose, the notorious Earl of Bridgeton, to teach her how to ruin herself, thus rendering herself unmarriageable. Envisioning the day when the luscious Sara winds up in his bed, Nick is all too happy to oblige-but when he sees her "practicing" her lessons on other men, he&#x2032;s inexplicably enraged. Then comes the day Sara&#x2032;s brothers catch her and Nick in a compromising position-which leads to a speedy marriage neither wants. Can the love they don&#x2032;t recognize find a way through their warring desires?</p></p><p>Beautiful young widow Sara Lawrence has vowed to foil her brothers' plans to marry her off again. Her first marriage was a disaster and she's determined to pick a biddable husband who will leave her to her own devices. But her exasperating, adoring, and interfering five older brothers are determined to protect her. Sara is just as determined to choose her own husband, but possible candidates are few in Bath--until the scandalous Nicholas Montrose, the Earl of Bridgeton, arrives. Nicholas takes one look at Sara and wants her in his bed, but she clearly desires marriage, and wedded bliss is not in Nicholas's plans. Furthermore, Nicholas has set his sights on establishing respectability, while Sara doesn't care a fig if she scandalizes society. Despite their differences, he can't resist the lovely Sara and agrees to aid her in her search for a pliable husband. Sara's brothers are irate when they realize that Nicholas is squiring Sara about town, and when they catch the two in a compromising position, they demand that they marry. Will Nicholas give up his rakish ways for Sara and, even if he will, is Sara willing to marry a man whom she's sure will be possessive and worse, will surely endanger her vulnerable heart? Author Karen Hawkins has a way with witty repartee and this fast-paced battle of the sexes is Regency romance at it's best. There's nothing quite so much fun as a tale of a strong-willed woman taming a bad-boy hero. Don't miss this one. <i>--Lois Faye Dyer</i><p>Karen Hawkins was raised in Tennessee, a member of a huge extended family that included her brother and sister, an adopted sister, numerous foster siblings, and various exchange students.

In <i>Tasmania's Convicts</i>, Alison Alexander tells the history of the men and women transported to what became one of Britain's most notorious convict colonies. Following the lives of dozens of convicts and their families, she uncovers stories of success, failure, and everything in between. While some suffered harsh conditions, most served their time and were freed, becoming ordinary and peaceful citizens. Yet over the decades, a terrible stigma became associated with the convicts, and they and the whole colony went to extraordinary lengths to hide it. The majority of Tasmanians today have convict ancestry, whether they know it or not. While the public stigma of its convict past has given way to a contemporary fascination with colonial history, Alison Alexander debates whether the convict past lingers deep in the psyche of white Tasmania.</p><p><b>Alison Alexander</b> is a seventh-generation Australian, with convict ancestors in the first, second, and third fleet. She has worked as a freelance historian and as a lecturer and tutor in history at the University of Tasmania.

She has also written biographies of authors Mary Grant Bruce and Marie Bjelke-Petersen, and a combined biography of governors' wives and mistresses in early Van Diemen's Land.Alexander has written a book which sparkles with fascinating anecdotes and incidents; taken together they give us a wonderful and enriching insight into the workings of the convict system -- Henry Reynolds Tasmania&#39;s convict ancestors, so long figures of shame to their descendants, are examined here in rich and unprecedented detail.

On each page, a deceptively simple item--<i>stocking, snowman, reindeer</i>--pulls readers into a nostalgic, exquisitely detailed moment of the yuletide journey: a trip in Santa's sleigh, supper with Mr. and Mrs. Claus, watching the elves hard at work, and finally arriving home in time for Christmas morning. <br><br>Secret clues, plus hidden allusions to classic Christmas carols, elevate this from a gorgeous book to an interactive holiday treasure hunt--a natural fit for the whole family at Christmastime.</p><p>Alison Jay lives in London, England.*Starred Review* Christmas Eve gets a particularly imaginative treatment&#x2014;a lovely one, too&#x2014;in this almost wordless story that follows a brother and sister from their front hall to the North Pole. Each picture, done in Jay&#x2019;s distinctive, folk-art style, layered with crackle varnish, uses symbols of the season to bring the children closer to seeing Santa. The one or two words of text per page (holiday card, stocking, reindeer) are matched by vignettes of different shapes and some full-page images, and many pictures are set against snowy backgrounds. Whimsy abounds as carolers pass a lively snowman who then sleds close to a polar bear. Though at first glance straightforward, the pages hold many surprises for those who look closely: characters from previous pictures dot the succeeding landscapes, and images from Christmas songs are tucked in the paintings for children to find (the Little Drummer Boy is a toy in Santa&#x2019;s workshop). Since Jay is British, some of these songs, like The Holly and the Ivy, won&#x2019;t be as familiar as others; but who doesn&#x2019;t know Rudolph, even though he is wearing a ski sweater? Perhaps the best part of this book is that it carries with it the magic of Christmas: the unexpected, the warmth, the wonder.

She has never really noticed what a peculiar bunch of nomads her eight-member Air Force family is (with the exception of her Post Princess sister, Kit), until the summer after her first year of college when she joins them at their new assignment: Kadena Air Base, Okinawa.<br><br>Just as Okinawa turns out to be a sorry version of the Japanese paradise Bernie knew in her childhood at Yokota Air Base, her family, especially her once-beautiful mother, Moe, and her former spy-pilot father, Mace, seems to have been in decline since those glory days of the American Raj. Days when her mother was happy and their best friend, Fumiko, now lost to them, was the family&#x2019;s maid. The worst part of Okinawa for Bernie, though, is realizing how perfectly she fits with her oddball family and how badly she needs to get out.<br><br>So when a dance contest first prize, a trip to Japan,offers a chance to escape, she takes it, playing second banana to a third-rate comedian on a tour of Japan&#x2019;s military bases.

How can a story about dispossession and unspeakable loss, about fading national glory and family heartbreak, be so consistently--and authentically--hilarious? Sarah Bird's novel is an unforgettable melding of exuberant wit and deep compassion." --<b>Stephen Harrigan</b><br><br>"Who else can write about dancing, music, JP-4 fuel, the military, and strawberries, make it funny, and also make it about matters of the heart? Only Sarah Bird. This is her best book yet, a big book that you'll want to read again as soon as you finish it the first time." -<b>Clyde Edgerton</b><br><br>"The first half of this book will make you scream with laughter. The second half will tear your heart out. Very few novelists have gotten the military brat story right. Believe me, Sarah Bird gets it right.

We are so very lucky that Sarah Bird has brought her immense talents to the telling of our story." -<b>Mary Edwards Wertsch</b>, author of <i>Military Brats: Legacies of Childhood Inside the Fortress<br><br></i>"From the family car to forbidden airspace, this is a wonderful book.

Or if you've ever felt trapped." <b>--Roy Blount, Jr. <br><br></b>"Sweet, powerful, and terrifying, Sarah Bird's talent, always substantial, achieves in <i>The Yokota Officers Club</i> an even greater depth and force that is nothing less than wondrous. This book is a beautiful and breathtaking treasure, and I thank her for it." <b>--Rick Bass<br><br></b>"Sarah Bird's world, viewed through the eyes and memories of a sassy Air Force brat, is our world: tender, hurtful, complex, unexplained. She captures the certainty we all have growing up, that we are the serpent who drove our parents out of the Eden of our childhood. Funny, wrenching, singularly moving, <i>The Yokota Officers Club</i> is a marvelous story. You'll want to share it with everyone who knew you when." <b> -- Shelby Hearon<br></b><br>"A bittersweet and often funny novel about being different; about secrets; and about what happens when the luster fades.

Who is Coningsby? Where is The Moonstone? When does one need A Room of One&#39;s Own? Why is it that Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit? And just how good is the British novel? These are just a few of the questions answered in The Columbia History of the British Novel. John Richetti&#39;s comprehensive history takes us from the birth of the novel in the eighteenth century through its social and culture-conscious growing pains in the nineteenth century to its angst-ridden maturity in the twentieth century. Concise, cohesive, and complementary to any collection of must-read classics, The Columbia History of the British Novel challenges and enlightens us by examining canonical writers as well as women and postcolonial novelists. Discover the origins of the novel in the &#34;scandalous&#34; books of Aphra Behn, Eliza Haywood, and Delarivier Manley and follow its development through Samuel Richardson, Henry Fielding, and Laurence Sterne against the backdrop of the novel&#39;s meteoric rise in the 1700s. Follow Frances Burney and the rise of the woman novelist, and the gothic novel as invented by Horace Walpole and perfected by Mary Shelley and Matthew Lewis. Remember remarkable reunions in Jane Austen; the bond between chivalry, Waverley, and Sir Walter Scott; the Brontes, Amelia Opie, Maria Edgeworth, and the tradition of Romantic women&#39;s fiction; Charles Dickens and the professionalization of literature; George Eliot and the novel of ideas; and Wilkie Collins and the sensation mania of the 1860s. Continue through the nineteenth century with the &#34;Condition of England&#34; novels of Benjamin Disraeli and Elizabeth Gaskell, Hardy&#39;s tales of class and sexualdifference, and Anglo-Indian perspectives on the empire from Rudyard Kipling and Philip Meadows Taylor. Enter the twentieth century and examine the modern novel with Joseph Conrad, James Joyce, and Virginia Woolf. Then trace the anti-modernist movement with Kingsley Amis, C. P. Snow, and Angus Wilson and, finally, keep up with contemporaries - Doris Lessing, A. S. Byatt, Anita Brookner, Julian Barnes, Kazuo Ishiguro, and Jeanette Winterson. The Columbia History of the British Novel lets us do all these things as it presents literary critics: Toni Bowers on early amatory fiction; James Thompson on Jane Austen; Ina Ferris on William Thackeray; David Trotter on Arnold Bennett, George Moore, and George Gissing; Michael Gorra on colonial and postcolonial novels from Rudyard Kipling to Salman Rushdie; Michael Seidel on James Joyce; and Carol McGuirk on postwar feminisms from Margaret Drabble to Angela Carter. The Columbia History of the British Novel examines classics in light of the critical theories of Bakhtin, Lukacs, and Foucault, among others, as well as a panoply of such subgenres as picaresque fiction, adventures, travelogues, utopian and dystopian prose, historical romances, detective novels, sentimental novels, and the Bildungsroman. This superb history also includes brief biographies of novelists discussed and lists of further reading.</p><h2>The Bride Collector</h2><p>FBI Special agent Brad Raines is facing his toughest case yet.

In this white-knuckle ride, FBI Special Agent Brad Raines faces off with psychopath Quentin Gauld. Here&#39;s a character so intelligent yet so twisted and evil that there are times the listener forgets to breathe. You want it to stop, but you don&#39;t want to miss a word. Glover relishes each twisted, bloodcurdling phrase as he climbs into the skin of the killer, allowing listeners a glimpse into the psyche of a monstrous creation. Kudos to Dekker and Glover. R.O.

But there's space in the document-tube for another sheet of paper.<br> <br>Purple and Black will be printed in two colors throughout.</p><p>Starred Review. In this heartbreaking epistolary novella, pseudonymous military fantasist Parker (<i>The Company</i>) keeps the letters, humor and tension moving at a quick clip. Nicephorus becomes the reluctant emperor of the Vesani after all his imperial relatives kill one other off. Knowing that 72 of the past century's 77 emperors have been murdered by the military, he appoints his trusted friend Phormio to command on a frontier filled with almost preternaturally effective insurgents. Each man sends two letters at a time to the other: one in official purple ink, the other a black-inked personal missive ranging from hilarious to despairing. As enemies become stalwart allies, sorrow lurks within victory and a forgotten moment of youth threatens everything, Parker sends the brief (but never terse) story flying to a wrenching and all too realistic conclusion. <i>(July)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

And the trail is indeed long, but by no means laborious, for Dr Robinson's style is easy, even conversational. A book as much for the beginner as for the academic NT scholar' (CEM Review), 'The greatest pleasure Dr Robinson gives is purely intellectual. His book is a prodigious virtuoso exercise in inductive reasoning, and an object-lesson in the nature of historical argument and historical knowledge. It is, I think, the finest of all his writings, and its energy is marvellous' (TheListener). 'in fewer than 400 pages, Bishop Robinson challenges almost all the judgments which teachers of the New Testament throughout the world commend to their pupils on the dating of the NT books : his reassessment has the simple effect of having them all completed before AD 70. The rumour of this revolutionary conclusion has already given the book notoriety and led some either to dismiss it out of hand or to lose patience with what is taken to be frivolous donnish antics. It would be a great pity if this were to become its dominant reputation, for it is, as we should expect, a work of extensive and careful scholarship, raising serious if unfashionable questions ... I am grateful to Bishop Robinson for compelling me to reopen my mind on any problems in the NT and happy to acknowledge with him that 'all the statements' which he puts forward 'should be taken as questions.' Many will profit from having to think afresh and to realize how little we truly know about the origin of those brief but powerful old books' (J. L. Houlden in New Fire). <br></p><p>John A. T.

Wachterhauser's collection <i>Hermeneutics and Truth </i>is an attempt to contribute to this concersation. &nbsp;<br>No thinkers have wrestled with the&nbsp;issue of truth&nbsp;and interpretation in more illuminating ways for the Continental tradition of philosophy than Heidegger and&nbsp;Gadamer. <i>Hermeneutics and Truth </i>is a dual focus on Heidegger and Gadamer, but it concentrates primarily on Gadamer's efforts to think through the issue of truth for hermeneutics and only secondaily on Heidegger's thought on this&nbsp;issue.&nbsp;</p><p>Brice R.

Dillon's classic study of Merleau-Ponty is now available in a revised second edition containing a new preface and a new chapter on "Truth in Art." Dillon's thesis is that Merleau-Ponty has developed the first genuine alternative to ontological dualism seen in Western philosophy. From his early work on the philosophical significance of the human body to his later ontology of flesh, Merleau-Ponty shows that the perennial problems growing out of dualistic conceptions of mind and body, subject and object, immanence and transcendence can be resolved within the framework of a new way of thinking based on the exemplar of the worldly embodiment of thought.<br></p><p>M.C. Dillon was Distinguished Teaching Professor of Philosophy at Binghamton University. His publicaions include <i>Merleau-Ponty Vivant</i>, <i>Semiological Reductionism: A Critique of the Deconstructionist Movement in Postmodern Thought</i>, <i> Ecart and Differance: Merleau-Ponty and Derrida on Seeing and Writing</i>, and mroe than fifty journal raticles, many of which are devoted to Merleau-Ponty scholarship.<br></p><h2>Dragonslippers: This is What an Abusive Relationship Looks Like</h2><p>Rosalind B. Penfold is an appealing, successful thirty-five-year-old businesswoman running her own company when her parents, worried that she works too hard, invite her to a country picnic-party one weekend. There she meets widower Brian and is swept off her feet. Romantic and exuberant, with four loving children, Brian seems like everything a woman could possibly want, and Roz falls deeply in love. But soon Roz begins to notice troubling signs that Brian is not what he seems. A pattern of lies and petty cruelties begins to emerge that, over the course of their decade together, comes to encompass a litany of physical, mental, and sexual abuse appalling in its scope and malevolence. Often too traumatized and ashamed to admit the true extent of what she is experiencing, Roz instead pours her anguish into a series of graphic diaries that provide a touching, profoundly shocking, and completely original portrait of domestic abuse.<br><br>An extraordinary visual testimony, <i>Dragonslippers</i> presents the many warning signs of abuse and offers a frank examination of the psychology of both abusers and victims. Above all, this is the story of a woman who fights for and finds the strength to break free.<br></p><p>Rosalind B. Penfold is a pseudonym.In this deft, honest work, writer-illustrator Penfold documents how she traveled from successful businesswoman to abused wife and back again. With a simple, na�ve drawing style and matter-of-fact tone, Penfold illustrates just how a confident person can be seduced and dominated by another. Her story starts when she meets Brian at a party and he sweeps her off her feet. A widower, he's ready for a full-time woman in his life, and Roz rapidly becomes absorbed into his sphere, sharing outings and devoting her weekends to his four children. But warning bells start ringing even before they leave for their whirlwind wedding in Greece, and his Jekyll and Hyde routine begins almost immediately after. Penfold, a well-adjusted and compassionate woman, is at first confused by his behavior and reluctant to write off her husband as an abusive, possibly schizophrenic, probable alcoholic. She questions herself, and tries harder, sticking around because she feels deeply responsible for his children, even as his behavior becomes ever more erratic and horrifying. Penfold's simplistic art and direct style are nothing fancy, but they still enable her to tell a compelling story&#x2014;readers will be relieved by the strength she shows to leave this doomed relationship. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It's something we do everywhere, whether feeling our way through a bedroom in the dark, or charting a ship's course. But how does navigation affect our brains, our memory, ourselves? Blending scientific research and memoir, and written in beautiful prose, <i>Finding North</i> starts with a quest by the author to understand this most basic of human skills---and why it's in mortal peril.</p><p>In 1844, Foy's great-great grandfather, captain of a Norwegian cargo ship, perished at sea after getting lost in a snowstorm. Foy decides to unravel the mystery surrounding Halvor Michelsen's death---and the roots of his own obsession with navigation---by re-creating his ancestor's trip using only period instruments. </p><p>Beforehand, he meets a colorful cast of characters to learn whether men really have better directional skills than women, how cells, eels, and spaceships navigate; and how tragedy results from GPS glitches. He interviews a cabby who has memorized every street in London, sails on a Haitian cargo sloop, and visits the site of a secret navigational cult in Greece.</p><p>At the heart of Foy's story is this fact: navigation and the brain's memory centers are inextricably linked. As Foy unravels the secret behind Halvor's death, he also discovers why forsaking our navigation skills in favor of GPS may lead not only to Alzheimers and other diseases of memory, but to losing a key part of what makes us human.</p></p><p>GEORGE MICHELSEN FOY is the author of<i> Zero Decibels: The Quest for Absolute Silence</i> and twelve critically acclaimed novels.

It's a voyage that is both personal and expansive, exploring how navigation works and its meaning in people's lives.&#x201d; &#x2015;<b>Andrew Johnston, author of <i>Time and Navigation </i> and <i>Earth from Space</i></b><br><b></b><br>&#x201c;With engaging and personal prose, George Michelsen Foy explores the history, natural history, and&#x2015;most critically&#x2015;the vital importance for us today of navigation. In an age when we too often rely on technology to tell us where we are and where we're going, Foy's compelling story asks at what cost? What do we lose when we allow our skills of navigation&#x2015;earned through centuries of finding our way in a wild and sometimes foreboding world&#x2015;to fade? As we careen further into a century of global change, Foy shows how in a world of 'mystery and fear, and the near certainty of loss,' we will need these skills of navigation more than ever. &#x2015;<b>Paul Bogard, author of <i>The End of Night</i></b><br><b></b><br>&#x201c;George Foy frames his story of the history and practice of navigation with a hazardous personal sea voyage in a ship that might not be in good enough repair to make the trip. It's a wonderful device which he also uses to chart a difficult navigational path through his inner world&#x2015;his seafaring ancestors; the tragic loss of his brother; his family; and his fears. And all of this is delivered in sensible, warm, and intelligent prose. Voyagers of all kinds will cherish this book?.&#x201d; <b>&#x2015;</b><b>Paul Raeburn, author of <i>The Game Theorist's Guide to Parenting</i> and<i> Do Fathers Matter?</i></b></p><p>&#x201c;Anyone who&#x2019;s ever charted a course &#x2013; or dreamt of traveling to the stars &#x2013; will enjoy Finding North.&#x201d; <b><i>&#x2015;WindCheck Magazine</i></b></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Foy takes us on an adventure... Instead of forcing us into a trap of hate and obsession he leads us gently with good humor upon a passage lit by compassion. This is another lesson in navigation: To find our way we cannot succumb to monomania. Navigation incites and inspires us to take everything into account. And, as Foy demonstrates, this requires us to do the difficult thing whenever it resonates with the needle of our compass. At such times what is hard is not a chore. It is a vessel for joy.&#x201d; <b>&#x2015;Horizons of Significance</b><br>&#x201c;Informative [and] well written...

Sticks appeared to be tumbling through the air before it. Then Jarrett realized they were too far away to be sticks. My god, he thought, those are trees."</i><p> Wildfires were a terrifying experience 100 years ago, and they have become equally terrifying to many Americans in recent drought years. <i>The Big Burn</i> is based on the true story of one of the worst wildfires of the century, a conflagration that destroyed 2.5 million acres of public land and killed 90 people. In the hot, dry summer of 1910, hundreds of small fires were burning all over Montana and the Idaho panhandle, lit by dry thunderstorms, sparks from trains, untended campfires. On August 20, a blowup began as the many blazes, pushed by wind, raced up the slopes until they joined to ignite a crown fire that roared across treetops, creating its own wind in a mighty inferno.</p><p> This novel tells the story of three pairs of young people in the fire's path: Ranger Samuel Logan and his 16-year-old brother Jarrett, who yearns to fight this fiery monster; Lizbeth, who loves the forest, and her aunt Celia, who wants only to profit from it; and two African American soldiers, honorable Seth and his shifty sidekick, Abel. The way their lives interlock with the fire and each other, and the "field notes" that document the course of the blaze make up a thrilling novel with much authenticity for the place and time and for the nature of wildfire itself.

But Henny wants a brood of chicks and she needs her eggs. With the help of clever Hedgie, she substitutes an acorn, a strawberry, a mushroom and finally a potato in her nest. But nothing stops that Tomten until the little hedgehog hides in Henny's nest: when the Tomten reaches in to get his morning treat, all he gets is a handful of prickles. He runs home for porridge and never comes back again! Intricate needlepoint patterns of Scandinavian designs frame the characters reacting from the borders in this beautiful picture book set in Denmark.</p><p>Henny doesn't know what to do. Every morning the irksome gnomelike Tomten steals her egg and takes it home to cook in his kettle and gobble up for breakfast. But when she sees Goosey-Goosey sailing by with a gaggle of goslings, Henny is suddenly galvanized to do <i>something</i>. Will she never have chicks of her own? She consults her wise friend Hedgie the Hedgehog, who comes up with a clever plan guaranteed to give the Tomten a sharp lesson in appropriate behavior. <p> Jan Brett's trademark illustrations--detailed watercolors bordered by intricate needlepoint patterns---capture the charm and mischief of this Scandinavian-style folk tale set in Denmark.

While the vocabulary in these letters is simple, the thoughts are profound.<p>These three epistles have long been at the center of the gospel debate. Entire books on assurance have been written based on an extremely unfortunate misunderstanding of First John. Such books undermine assurance by wrongly pointing readers to their works, rather than Christ, for their assurance.</p><p>In this remarkable commentary the reader will find both solid exegesis and practical application.

Odom interweaves the experiences of his four major characters--Jherek, a virtuous young sailor who wants to disassociate himself from his vicious pirate father; Laaqueel, a humanoid priestess who seeks the acceptance of the fishlike sahuagin; Iakhovas, an ancient megalomaniac sorcerer who has enslaved Laaqueel and desires to take over the sea; and Pacys, an aged bard of formidable mind and body--as they set off across oceans, fighting battles. Each character's quest pulls him or her toward a city called Baldur's Deep. Odom does an admirable job of bringing the sea setting and its varied species to life.

Written in Sanskrit, it is attributed to Vatsyayana, also known as Mallanaga. &#39;Kama&#39; is the Hindu word for love, pleasure, and sensual gratification; and &#39;sutra&#39; are aphorisms. The work is partly a marriage manual containing specific sexual information, including the arts of scratching, biting, and pinching. But the enormous influence of the Kama Sutra stems from its wider discussion of women, courtship, and the place of erotic pleasure in the urbane life of a man or woman of leisure. It was first translated into English in 1883 by the famous explorer, Sir Richard Francis Burton. Kama Sutra of Vatsysyana in Pop-up uses exerts from the original text, as translated by Richard Burton, and color plates from the authentic Indian illustrations that show how to perfect your lovemaking skills. There are also six pop-up sections, showing a selection of the most interesting positions from the Kama Sutra in three-dimensions, using the latest in paper-engineering techniques.

Starting with versatile supermarket cake mixes and adding just the right extras-including melted semisweet chocolate bars, chocolate chips, or cocoa powder, plus fresh eggs or a bit of buttermilk, dried coconut, mashed bananas, or instant coffee powder-a baker at any level of experience can turn out dark, rich, moist, delicious chocolate layer cakes, time and again. Not to mention sheet cakes, pound cakes, cupcakes and muffins, cheesecakes, cookies, brownies, and bars.

Her first book, <i>The Cake Mix Doctor</i>, showed readers how to tweak store-bought cake mixes to produce "like-homemade" treats. The sequel, <i>Chocolate from the Cake Mix Doctor</i> repeats Byrn's foolproof approach, focusing solely on chocolate. The strategy? Begin with commercial mixes like chocolate cake, devil's food, and chocolate brownie; alter them with ingredients that add flavor, such as cocoa powder, or richness and moistness, like sour cream; use homemade frostings (supermarket versions won't cut it); and you're in business. "My mission," says Byrn, "is to help busy cooks find the time to bake even when company is <i>not</i> coming." If her sweets lack true homemade quality, they nonetheless produce entirely creditable desserts most bakers, and those they feed, will applaud.<p> Beginning with a blueprint for mix-doctoring success, which includes information on pantry essentials and a useful chocolate primer, the book then presents over 150 easy recipes for a full range of chocolate layer, pound, sheet, angel food, and chiffon cakes, as well as muffins, cookies, brownies, and more. Among these, readers will surely want to try Triple Decker Raspberry Chocolate Cake, White Chocolate Peach Cake, Frozen Chocolate Neapolitan Cake, and Jessica's Caramel Chocolate Brownies.

Miller wanted an open, light-filled house that could also act as a studio for her fashionably avant-garde exercise course in posture and grace, &#34;The Mensendieck System.&#34; This unique program, combined with the desert landscape and the proactive health-minded client appealed to the idealist in Neutra. The frequent, fervent dialog between Neutra and Miller, who had great mutual respect, produced a work of forward-thinking and artful architecture. In Richard Neutra&#39;s Miller House, Stephen Leet traces the conception and realization of the house, examines the complex relationship between architect and client, and shows how the Mensendieck System influenced the creation of this seminal Neutra project. Beautiful duotone photographs by Julius Shulman, excerpts from the detailed correspondence between Neutra and Miller, and sketches and drawing provide valuable insight into the design process. Like the houses of Albert Frey, a contemporary of Neutra&#39;s who also build in the desert, the Miller House shows how architecture, the California landscape, and an interest in well-being can intersect in a moment of the architectural sublime.</p><p>Following her husband&#39;s death in 1936, Grace Lewis Miller (1895-1976) left Missouri to relocate in Palm Springs, California.

Settled in 1630 by John Winthrop--who would later become governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony--Ten Hills Farm was a six-hundred-acre estate just north of Boston. Winthrop, famous for envisioning his 'city on the hill' and lauded as a paragon of justice, owned slaves on that ground and passed the first law in North America condoning slavery. In this mesmerizing narrative, C. S. Manegold exposes how the fates of the land and the families that lived on it were bound to America's most tragic and tainted legacy. Challenging received ideas about America and the Atlantic world, Ten Hills Farm digs deep to bring the story of slavery in the North full circle--from concealment to recovery.</p><br><p> Manegold follows the compelling tale from the early seventeenth to the early twenty-first century, from New England, through the South, to the sprawling slave plantations of the Caribbean. John Winthrop, famous for envisioning his "city on the hill" and lauded as a paragon of justice, owned slaves on that ground and passed the first law in North America condoning slavery. Each successive owner of Ten Hills Farm--from John Usher, who was born into money, to Isaac Royall, who began as a humble carpenter's son and made his fortune in Antigua--would depend upon slavery's profits until the 1780s, when Massachusetts abolished the practice. In time, the land became a city, its questionable past discreetly buried, until now.</p><br><p> Challenging received ideas about America and the Atlantic world, <i>Ten Hills Farm</i> digs deep to bring the story of slavery in the North full circle--from concealment to recovery.</p></p><p><p>"C.

Yet, there are few written records of West Africa's major beliefs, rituals, and ceremonies. <i>The Way of the Elders</i> co-authored by a West African native raised in the Mande tradition offers rare and authentic insight into the spirituality of West Africa, and particularly the Mande culture. <br> <br>This spiritual guidebook explains fundamental beliefs, such as reverence for the One Spirit, that permeate tribal life. Offerings, charms, herbal healing, shamans and their functions, the importance of wildlife, and the four elements of nature are discussed in detail. The second half of the book is devoted to sacred living and focuses on village life, sacred music and dance, pregnancy, birth, childhood initiation, marriage, death, and funerals. <br></p><p>Adama Doumbia (Oakland, CA) was born in Dakar, Senegal, and grew up learning the customs of Bamana, Fulani, and Wolof peoples.

Spirit is both near and far, as immanent as the earth and as transcendent as the sky. We recognize the strength and power of the Almighty through a thunderous storm; we feel the reliability and comfort of the Eternal with the rising sun; we observe the grace and beauty of the Creator in a dancing stream. In all of our surroundings, we experience the essence of the Divine. We celebrate Spirit's many qualities apparent or hidden in every form. Each plant, rock, animal, and person tells the story of creation and serves to nurture, teach, and guide us on our life journeys. Our belief that we are all a part of one Spirit affects our relations with one another; the action of one member of the community is felt by every one of us. The ultimate receiver of all prayers, Spirit is always a part of our greetings and blessings. We maintain deep reverence and awe for Spirit. <br> <br>Spirits <br>Every spirit belongs to Spirit. We pray to these sacred mediators who share in the Supreme power.1 Our spiritual well-being is dependent upon our relationship to them; every one of us has the power to commune with these forces through prayer and sacrifice. Before we swim or fish, we make peace with the spirits of the water. Before we hunt or gather wood, we make peace with the spirits of the bush. Before we farm, we make peace with the spirits of the earth. They tell us what kind of sacrifice they desire; each divinity has its own special song, rhythm, color, and sacrificial animal. Sometimes they trouble us when we do not show proper respect to the earth or to one another. If there is too much rain or drought, or any disruption in our environment, we do not attribute it to Spirit but to the divinities to whom we may have not shown proper reverence. Spirits teach us how to bring order, peace, and harmony to our communities. <br> <br>Some of our spirits lived as human beings; others are forces of nature. They respond to our petitions, though they also operate from their own agendas. If we are unaware of any spirits, they are better able to exercise their own will and roam about freely. The focus of our lives is how effectively to interact with the world of Spirit. They are always communicating their wishes, demands, and prescriptions to us directly, or through our diviners and healers. Divinities draw their power and wisdom from Spirit, and we draw ours from them. <br> <br>Spirit's Energy <br>Nyama is the energy that emanates from Spirit and flows throughout the universe.2 It is the life force that links all of existence together; humans, animals, plants, and minerals. The power of creation and destruction, nyama commands everything from bountiful harvests to droughts and plagues; it directs the twinkling stars and the rippling tides. This energy of the universe shapes nature into its many forms and yields to our handling of its power. <br> <br>We draw life from this potent force that connects all of creation. It is the fuel for all of our activities. Nyama is the source of energy for every word, thought, and action. To live harmoniously with nature, we live with a sensitivity to the power of nyama. To recognize this energy is to appreciate that everything is interconnected, integral parts of a whole. <br> <br>Those of us with high levels of nyama, such as shamans, diviners, blacksmiths, bards, and hunters, can maneuver this energy and direct it at will.3 The ability to channel nyama requires access to advanced levels of mystical knowledge. Those who possess this knowledge hold great influence in our communities. One may devote limitless time and effort to learn how to direct this energy, but most of us leave it to our artisans who inherit large concentrations of nyama from their ancestors. Many of our artisans marry within their own group to maintain their high levels of this energy. One must also learn to handle nyama through intensive training, as it can be deadly if one does not follow the appropriate rituals for engaging it. Our artisans spend their entire lives cultivating their relationship with this power. <br> <br>Our use of divination, charm making, and herbal healing draws upon our knowledge of this life force. Many of our artisans practice these forms of healing, enhancing and transforming our natural and social environments. Our blacksmiths work with the high levels of this energy present in the iron they shape and the woods they carve for our charms and ritual tools. As words carry power and are full of nyama, our bards possess great skill in directing these high levels of energy through their healing music and storytelling. Our hunters and leather workers handle massive amounts of nyama from the animals they hunt and the skins they treat, which we rely upon for our medicines and protective pieces. <br> <br>Our awareness of this awesome energy influences our efforts to live in balance and peace with all of Spirit's manifestations. Compassion, love, and selfless acts bring an abundance of this creative energy into our paths and serve to neutralize and keep at bay harmful nyama. Disruptive thoughts and actions can invite disharmony and destruction from this mysterious power. We remain in wonder of this energy of Spirit. <br> <br>Spirit Visitation <br>Spirits seldom possess us; they make visits upon us. Spirit visitation is our opportunity to commune with the divinities. We encourage spirit visitation as the whole community prospers when a spirit descends upon one of us. They provide healing and impart knowledge for those of us present. A spirit possesses an individual when it enters one among us uninvited and does not surrender. Spirit possessions may require the intervention of spirit mediums to release the possessing force and divine the reason for the possession. They often occur among those who try to harm others or who neglect to make peace with a particular spirit. Sometimes a divinity may make a surprise visit upon one of us to heal or relay an important message, but most of the time the spirits wait for our invitations. <br> <br>We may construct a special altar for a spirit, in the form of a shrine, if it begins to visit regularly and offer guidance and support. We keep the shrine in a ceremonial room or in our home and offer regular libations and prayers to keep it content and comfortable. <br> <br>Preparations <br>Before spirit visitation, those among us ready to receive a spirit must enter a fully open and meditative state, surrendering all expectations, needs, and desires. We clean ourselves, bathing with protective herbs to keep at bay unwanted forces. Frankincense is a common herb we burn at these ceremonies to ward off disruptive spirits. We also make a brew of protective herbs that no one at the ceremony may know, except the diviner who prepares them. We might wear special clothes to show our readiness to receive the spirit. We sometimes mark sacred symbols on our bodies with white chalk or clay, and wear powerful charms to strengthen us when the divinity visits. We may put white powder on our face and body to foster purity and well-being. We also prepare the ceremonial area with perfumes and water. The divinities enjoy the sweet smells and feel welcomed by our gifts. We may carry special herbs in a pot of water or place the shrines themselves on top of our heads to help bring on the visitation. <br> <br>Ceremony <br>Performing rituals and making sacrifices encourage the spirit's power and benevolence. We pour libations of palm wine, millet beer, or water. Our prayers and incantations include blessings for the members of the group, and an invitation of a spirit to the ceremony to perform revelations, wondrous transformations, and healing. We sacrifice an animal such as a chicken or a goat. We may sprinkle the blood of the animal on the shrine, or we may cut out the liver of the animal and offer it up on the shrine. Usually, we consume the meat of the sacrifice and the beverage of the libations, creating a unity among all of us and the spirit. <br> <br>We continue our prayers and communicate with the spirit through our music and dance. Sometimes we play a specific drum rhythm, which will encourage a particular spirit's visitation. The drumming, chanting, and dancing may include everyone present at the ceremony. Our ceremonies can last several hours or several days. <br> <br>Spirit Communion <br>Once the spirit descends, we speak and move in the manner of it, communicating its message to the community. When the spirit visits, we are not fully aware of what is happening; our voices may change, and our bodies may move and shake from the power of the divinity's presence. We may do things we would not ordinarily do as we become fully &nbsp;inhabited by the visiting spirit who has its own unique personality. We usually cannot make regular conversation or eye contact. We lose our vision of this world, and develop an inner vision. Some of us begin to speak a different language. Someone present will interpret the message from the spirit. When the divinity serves its purpose and departs, the visited among us often experience complete serenity and joy. <br> <br>Ancestors <br>Our ancestors are the closest to us of all the intermediary spirits; they are our guardian spirits. Our ancestors maintain their role in our families and lives, more significantly than when they were physically present. They are always available to us, offering their guidance and protection. <br> <br>With other divinities, we must first learn their particular language and preferred sacrifice to communicate with them. With our ancestors, we already speak their language; we know their preferences and wishes. At times, when we are neglectful or unaware, they send us signals to capture our attention. They teach us to know Spirit everywhere hidden behind the appearance of things. <br> <br>We pray for our ancestors and we perform sacrifice to honor their lives. We appreciate them for the life they gave us and the ways they continue to instruct and nurture us. They provide us with our names, our trades, and our knowledge. Every family receives its own set of rules and teachings from its ancestors. <br>Before each meal, we may place a piece of food on the ground as we call out the name of an ancestor. Friday is a special day when they like to eat with us. We may set aside a portion of food for them on this day, or we leave food out Thursday evening if they come overnight. Whenever we drink, we spill a little on the ground for them. We always serve a drink to the ancestors before posing a question or making a request of them. <br> <br>We may offer them their favorite foods, such as porridge, and pour it onto the earth and pray. They especially prefer when we offer balls of millet cakes. Libations of alcohol, such as millet beer, are another ancestral favorite. We give kola nuts, biscuits, and sugar away for offerings. We sacrifice a red or white chicken, and let the blood run into the soil and pray. As our ancestors have become one with the light, they especially like hats and shoes, which protect them from the brightness that surrounds them. We give away these items to people as offerings for our ancestors. <br> <br>We set up stones as altars for our ancestors and place them near our homes, in our yards, and in the center of the village. Sometimes we pray and make sacrifice where our ancestors lived or where they prayed. Often before we pray, we will chew pieces of kola nut, which we spit out onto their altar. The juice of the kola nut tempers our speech and ensures its purity and integrity. <br> <br>There is no formula to our prayer; we pray from our hearts. We talk with our ancestors as we do with those among us who are physically present. We ask them to work on our behalf in the world of Spirit. The most important way we honor our ancestors is how we live; they are always watching us. Sometimes our ancestors come to live among us, to help us through our children. The ways our children look or act reveal to us who they may be. <br> <br>Animal Spirits <br>Animal spirit comes to us as a protective divinity, preserving the village from poverty, hunger, and illness.4 This spirit also shields our community from harmful nyama and disruptive mystical practices. Animal spirits may come in the form of any animal, like a goat, donkey, lizard, snake, or horse. They sometimes come in the form of a tree, though they are usually able to transform themselves into some kind of an animal. <br> <br>These creatures generally do not like the light and dwell in caves, forests, or mountains, though they remain near to the village. In every village, one will make itself known and we will often give it a special name. Usually we honor one specific creature, but sometimes we may honor all animals of its kind. Many times it will possess special powers. In one village, a snake might change into many different colors and have no end to its length. <br> <br>Once an animal spirit makes itself known to the community, one must never harm or kill it, or members of its kind, as this can bring about destructive consequences.5 Entire villages have been known to burn down through the unintentional harming of the animal spirit, if a sacrifice was not immediately performed to appease it. Sometimes a family will have a special animal spirit that tells a story of the family's ancestors. The family will never eat or harm any incarnation of its divinity. <br> <br>We make a yearly sacrifice to our animal spirit, and we may also make visits to its dwelling place to thank it for a bountiful harvest. Our elders know where to make the sacrifice and what kind to make. In some villages only the elders are present during the ceremony, and in other villages everyone participates. Each house may provide a sacrifice to an elder who will make the offering to the animal spirit. Sometimes everyone in the village will cook and eat the sacrifice together. <br> <br>Each animal has its own sacrifice that it likes. Elders may offer a live chicken or goat that they house in the abode of the animal spirit for it to consume. They offer prayers for the continuance of peace and abundance within the community. A ceremony may last up to three days. <br> <br>Sometimes a woman who is experiencing difficulties conceiving a child may visit the spirit's site to offer porridge, kola nuts, or chicken blood to the animal. A person may make a sacrifice of an animal to secure a husband or wife. We teach our children at a young age what the animal looks like so they will not harm it. Animal spirits teach us to have respect for nature and all her creatures. <br> <br>Story of the Animal Spirit <br>Many of our family names come from our relationship to a particular animal spirit. A protective animal spirit of the Diara family is the lion (diara means &#x201c;lion&#x201d;). Snakes protect the Ciss�, Niar�, Dram�, and Doukour� families, and crocodiles watch over the Traor� and Mariko lineages. The elephant oversees the Samak� family (sama means &#x201c;elephant&#x201d;). Doumbia's animal spirit is the tiger, and members of this family are not to wear tiger-print clothing, nor harm this animal. <br> <br>Couloubaly is a common Mande name with a rich story behind its origination.6 Couloubaly, or kulun-bali, means &#x201c;no boat is there.&#x201d; This name comes from a special time, long ago, when a king and his younger brother ruled a quiet little community on the edge of the river. The people lived peacefully until, one day, a nearby kingdom threatened to overtake them. The neighboring army moved in quickly and overpowered the village inhabitants, but the two king brothers were able to escape to th...</p><h2>Coins</h2><p>In this richly illustrated book, John Porteous surveys the history of coinage in the western world from its emergence in Greece in the seventh Century BC until the present day</p><p></p><h2>Country Gentleman</h2><p>Chet Atkins, one of the founders of the country music movement and the developer of the finger-pickin&#39; style of guitar playing, was born to play music...country music.

Detective Inspector McGroom takes on the case and tracks down the missing painting. Each letter is given a full page and all but two ("X is the kiss..." and "Z is asleep...") have a word that begins with the letter. Most entries move the mystery along. There are occasional red herrings, such as K is a kilted bagpiper alongside the road and N is the number of steps. The rhyming couplets hold up well enough to please a read-aloud audience, but it is the illustrations that are sure to delight children. Bright cartoon creatures skillfully rendered with either subtle acrylics or very bold watercolors with pen-and-ink detail carry out the action. Although a badger, a wombat, and an aardvark have the lead roles, bemused mice add a charming touch. Cushman has created a fun alphabet for the young, who will like the rhyme and love the artwork. With such competition as Suse MacDonald's Alphabatics (Macmillan, 1986), Jim Aylesworth's Old Black Fly (Holt, 1992), Chris Van Allsburg's The Z Was Zapped (Clarion, 1987), and Bill Martin and John Archambault's Chicka Chicka Boom Boom (S.&amp;S., 1989), it is hard to insist on its addition, but it would be a shame to pass by this fresh approach to the ABCs.<br><i>Jody McCoy, Casady School, Oklahoma City</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.This cunning twist on the traditional ABC book offers more than meets the eye. Each page highlights a different letter of the alphabet with bold type and contains one sentence of a full-fledged whodunit that is solved by book's end. Although Cushman's ( Aunt Eater Loves a Mystery ) premise is witty, this volume is not wholly satisfying as a concept book. Readers sophisticated enough to appreciate the intricacies of the mystery are beyond learning their ABC's, while those new to letter identification may struggle with the abstract metaphors in the text: "C is the Clue that's left in the room." To the probable delight of picture book fans, however, the breezy and suspenseful story gathers momentum in all the right places. Cushman's airy watercolors depict a genteel and believable world of glorious green and flowering countryside, and nattily dressed animals. Successive readings offer plenty of opportunity for budding detectives to spot new clues.

A book for anyone touched by major illness or death, Going the Distance is an inspiring book by a man who wrote eloquently about the experience of living, of pushing to the limit as an athlete, and arriving at the finish line a changed person.</p><p>When Sheehan (This Running Life, 1980, etc.) was diagnosed with inoperable cancer, he turned his physician's eye and writer's ear to the subject of his own mortality, producing this posthumous volume. Dr. Johnson once observed that knowing that death is imminent has a wonderful way of focusing the mind. Dr. Sheehan was never someone who had trouble focusing in his writing. One of the great apostles of running, he wrotes columns and books that were always wonderfully lucid explorations of the balance between body, mind, and spirit. Not surprisingly, this volume, tracing his final journey toward death from prostate cancer, is more of the same, only more intense. The book, he says in the introduction, really has three subjects: It's ``about what dying actually means to a person undergoing it . . . a communion with others experiencing dying. And . . . an evaluation of my life.'' The first essay clearly began as a rumination on turning 70, but when Sheehan received the diagnosis of his cancer, it was transmuted into a very different story. And an inspiring story it is. Sheehan is completely frank about the indignities of fatal illness--pain and painkillers, loss of appetite and unappetizing food, constant fatigue and a sudden loss of powers. He is also mercilessly honest in self-evaluation. Finally, he draws on a lifetime of reading and writing to produce a luminous examination of those larger questions that we don't really confront until we must. From Epictetus to William James, Unamuno to Thornton Wilder, Sheehan has a knack for finding the right thought and thinker. In 1993, he died at peace with himself and his life, and left behind this last glowing gift. Almost unbearably moving at times, a must-read book for anyone facing severe illness or loss. -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Sheehan, the running cardiologist with several popular books on running to his credit, succumbed to prostate cancer in 1993. His account of approaching that eventuality combines self-reflection and observations on individual and social life. A loner, he speaks bluntly of relations with his family, betraying, some may feel, a selfishness that serves to indicate that he is human, after all, and no paragon. Sheehan says his early running was done to attain goals and set records, but in later years, he did it more to be with fellow runners. He also intriguingly observes that converts to running are driven by a desire to shorten periods of helplessness rather than to lengthen their lives. His account of his cancer diagnosis and treatment, as well as their effects on his family and professional lives, is thought-provoking and, occasionally, refreshingly humorous. This is a fitting conclusion to Sheehan's writing on running and health that should please athletes, physicians, and patients alike. <i>William Beatty</i></p><h2>The Dictionary of Ancient Egypt</h2><p>1st U.S. edition, hardcover in dust jacket, published by Harry N.

When he died in 1988 at the age of fifty, he was acclaimed as the greatest influence on the American short story since Hemingway. Carver's friends were the stuff of legend as well. In this rich collection&#x2014;greatly expanded from the earlier <i>When We Talk about Raymond Carver</i>&#x2014;of interviews with close companions, acquaintances, and family, Sam Halpert has chronologically arranged the reminiscences of Carver's adult life, recalling his difficult &#x201c;Bad Raymond&#x201d; days through his second life as a recovering alcoholic and triumphantly successful writer. The result is a spirited Irish wake&#x2014;toasts, anecdotes, lies, songs, confessions, laments&#x2014;all beautifully orchestrated by Halpert into a very readable and moving narrative.</p><p>These funny, poignant, intensely remembered interviews juxtapose personal anecdotes and enlightening criticism. Memory mixes with analysis, and a lively picture of Carver emerges as we hear different stories about him&#x2014;of the same story told from different viewpoints. He is here presented as hero, victim, and even villain&#x2014;Carver's readers will recognize the woof and warp of his stories in these affectionate narratives.</p></p><p>Halpert, a native of Brooklyn, New York, served as a navigator on B-17 bombers, flying more than thirty-five missions over Nazi Germany. After the war, he worked as a teacher and typographer until his retirement to Miami, Florida.Though this oral biography confesses to being a "toast" to a "beloved man," it is an engrossing, touching, and insightful remembrance of Carver by his family, friends, and fellow writers. We see the devastating effects of Carver's long bout with alcoholism and the pitiful poverty in which he, his first wife, and two children lived. Carver emerges as a funny and lovable man, despite his occasional alcohol-induced abusiveness. He recovered from his alcoholism and wrote productively once again for several years before his early death from lung cancer in 1988. These reminiscences include many insights into the sources and literary qualities of his writings. This highly readable oral biography is an expanded and rearranged version of When We Talk About Raymond Carver (Gibbs Smith, 1991). It should be included in good collections on 20th-century literature, especially those that did not acquire the earlier edition.?Peter Dollard, Alma Coll.

Using a unique blend of travel writing, anthropology, history and social observation, he explores how Britain&#39;s roads have their roots in unexpected places. He visits the Roman role in the way our roads are numbered, the ancient sat-nav systems of China of 2600BC and the unknown demonstrations against by-passes in the 1920s, and ends up at the roots of today&#39;s arguments about road pricing and road rage. Full of quirky nuggets of history, &#34;On Roads&#34; also celebrates the often overlooked people whose work we take for granted, such as Percy Shaw, the inventor of the catseye, Jock Kinneir and Margaret Calvert, the designers of the road sign system, and Charles Forte, the entrepreneur behind the service station. These stories of our past shed light on hidden changes in our society, the relation between people and nature and the invisibility of the mundane. And - on subjects ranging from speed limits to driving on the left, and the &#39;non-places&#39; where we stop to the unwritten laws of traffic jams - they have never been told together, until now.</p><p>Joe Moran is a Reader in Cultural History at Liverpool John Moores University. He writes regularly for The Guardian and the New Statesman, and the THES have tipped him as one of the bestselling academics of the future. He is the author of Queuing for Beginners, also published by Profile [9781861978417], and lives in Liverpool.A delightful look at the cultural history of our roads...Moran&#39;s reflections on traffic jams are also illuminating: after reading them the prospect of congestion is really quite alluring. -- Editor&#39;s Pick * The Bookseller * Entertaining stuff, a blend of history, cultural and social observation and travel writing which motors along nicely. Quirky, funny and a great gift buy for Father&#39;s Day. -- Booksellers Choice * The Bookseller * A warm-hearted, ingenious, endlessly fascinating exploration of our complicated relationship with the road. Joe Moran is single-handedly transforming the history of everyday life in modern Britain. -- David Kynaston Wonderful. Joe Moran is the master of turning the mundane realities of everyday life into the stuff of history, and in this book he has surpassed himself. From speed limits to Travelodges, nothing escapes his forensic examination, and almost no page is without some surprising insight. Whoever could have known that roads were so fascinating?&#39; -- Dominic Sandbrook Joe Moran is one of the most interesting and original observers of the minutiae of British life to emerge in a long while. -- Matthew Engel Truly wonderful...every minute devoted to this book is richly rewarded. It is hard to say which is the more remarkable here: the astonishing range and variety of what Joe Moran knows, or the easeful, evocative, luxuriously entertaining way he parcels it up and puts it across. -- David McKie, author of Great British Bus Journeys Joe Moran has a genius for turning the prosaic poetic - this is a tone poem in tarmac. Motorway journeys will never be so dull again. A treat. -- Peter Hennessy, author of Having It So Good A fascinating, thought-provoking and entertaining exposition of how we all get from A to B. Part history, part anthropology, Joe Moran gives meaning to the everyday in this compelling exploration of how Britain&#39;s roads function - and what they have come to mean. Somewhat akin to a modern day JB Priestley, he has gone in search of modern Britain by travelling its motorways, stopping at its service stations - and checking out its road rage. A wonderful book. Moran has fast become Britain&#39;s foremost explorer and explainer of the disregarded. -- Juliet Gardiner, author of Wartime: Britain 1939-1945 a really fascinating insight into everything from motorways to byways by one of Britain&#39; s best cultural studies academics. This is a really necessary book - one wonders why it hasn&#39;t been done before - that combines travel writing, history and anthropology to delve into roads as a social phenomena. -- Giles Foden * Conde Nast Traveller * Engaging... wide-ranging but succinct...he delves knowledgably into the history of the British road system...very instructive it is too. -- Robert Low * Standpoint * Strangely fascinating...Joe Moran has delved into the brute asphalt of the post-war British highway and found a curious poetry there. Moran&#39;s special interest is in the mundane parts of our lives that we often take for granted... On Roads, a beautifully-written, quiet masterpiece, looks at our experience of roads from the motorway age onwards... The book was inspired by a song by the band Black Box Recorder, declaring that &#34;the English motorway system is beautiful and strange&#34;. Moran gives a wonderful sense of both the beautiful and strange... [H]e has a knack for weaving together fascinating nuggets with a rare lightness of touch... Moran&#39;s genius is to show us what was right in front of us all along. -- Bee Wilson * Sunday Times * Joe Moran, a young academic with a healthy ego (he writes an interesting blog), an enviable ease with words and a dry sense of humour... The section on road signs is fascinating... -- Linda Christmas * Daily Telegraph * His terrific book is an imaginative history, then: a study of roads &#34;as cultural artefacts as much as concrete ones&#34;, which psychoanalyses post-war Britain through its road-network. Along the way he takes numerous turn-offs and diversions into subjects that really shouldn&#39;t be interesting, but which he makes fascinating: the development of the road atlas, for instance, or the history of the roadside verge... He is beautiful on flyovers as concrete sculptures, on ringroads as the condensation of motopian dreams; and his account of asphalt&#39;s near-miraculous deflective pliability is - forgive me for this - pitch-perfect. One of the many pleasures of this book is Moran&#39;s tone. Subtle parody and self-parody roll through the pages, preventing his obvious affection for roads from ever congealing into sentimentalism. His prose is tinged with a Morrisseyish melancholy for the glamour of seediness. He writes with knowingly glum bravado of Travelodges, petrol stations and road-kill. At the other end of his tonal range is a version of JG Ballard&#39;s techno-sublime, which sees roads as both inciting and earthing the psychopathologies of a culture. But most often he sounds to me like the Elvis Costello of &#34;London&#39;s Brilliant Parade&#34;: a singer of lugubrious songlines, geekily affectionate towards his chosen terrain, but suspicious of any easy declarations of love. Part extended essay, part prose-poem, On Roads is doubly successful. It offers a textualisation of the road-system as a unique archive of cultural history; and it offers a re-enchantment of the road, peddling a neoromanticism of the tarmac, according to which the Red House Interchange, the Redditch Cloverleaf and the Almondsbury Four-Level Stack are as resonant a series of place-names as the Ridgeway, Stonehenge and Silbury Hill. What Moran manages above all, in this entertainingly contrarian book, is to reclaim the road as a country of its own: a terrain vague, as worthy of exploration and study as a moorland or wood-pasture. &#34;The land surrounding rural motorways is ... vast and unknown&#34;, he notes in a typically fine early riff. &#34;If you are ever on the run from the law, I would strongly recommend that you hide in the wooded motorway verges of our oldest motorways, like the M1 or M6. There is just enough room for a tent in the half-century of undergrowth, and you could surely live like Stig of the Dump, undisturbed for months or years, in this uninhabited wilderness just a cone&#39;s throw from the road.&#34; -- Robert Macfarlane * The Guardian * [E]ngaging... His book is more a road rhapsody than a road requiem... On Roads, a richly enjoyable read, offers the sort of accessible cultural history once championed by New Society magazine. It has an eye for the everyday, the easily overlooked and the downright unlikely - service stations, road humps, speed limits, hitch-hiking, dawdling caravans, lorries...impeccably researched. -- Stephen McClarence * The Times * Sparkling ... Moran steers effortlessly away from jargon, and his tone maintains a delicious balance between sardonic amazement at the strange people we are and joy in the surprises and absurdities he bumps into along his way...The theme is a love affair and its end, a tale sad and uplifting. -- Tom Fort * Sunday Telegraph * There&#39;s considerable beauty in this book. Moran has a poet&#39;s eye for detail and expression and an astonishing range of cultural reference... It is rich with anecdote...In this lucid, entertaining book, Moran illuminates dark corners of experience, opens our eyes to fresh narratives and, yes, even brings the romance of the road to life. -- Martin Fletcher * The Independent * [A] pleasant book... Read it before a long journey, and you may regard the boring old motorway with a new appreciation. -- Not attributed * The Economist * [P]acked with fascinating detail. One reads on in the way one pushes on just one more service station or one more Travelodge on a long journey, partly because the journey is too hypnotic to interrupt... On Roads restores some of the modernist excitement off fast travel and the existential dread of gridlock. -- Brian Morton * The Glasgow Herald * I enjoyed On Roads immensely... pro-road propaganda so balanced and erudite that it might tempt some of us into getting off the bus and on to the M25, or at least on to some of the lesser-known roads Moran writes about so elegantly... -- Owen Hattersley * New Statesman * [A] book that is fresh and original... Moran is terrific on all the quirky nonsense... He accurately chronicles the way attitudes flipped quickly from the 1960s, when new motorways were seen as cool and modern - and, indeed, beguilingly American - to the environmentally-minded 1970s. -- Matthew Engel * Financial Times * I&#39;ve been reading, with equal parts pleasure and profit, Joe Moran&#39;s On Roads. It&#39;s expansive, unexpected cultural history and in some ways an ideal companion volume to Traffic ... it&#39;s loaded with strange and delightful details ... I&#39;ve got many pages folded over... -- Tom Vanderbilt, author of Traffic [A] clever and engaging history... fascinating...takes a slippery subject...and succeeds brilliantly in making it meaningful. -- Nick Rennison * Waterstone&#39;s Books Quarterly * [A]n imaginative and original attempt to make roads interesting. -- Laurie Taylor * BBC Radio 4 Thinking Allowed * Every page contains something enthralling or bizarre or funny or perceptive ... Moran has the poet&#39;s ability to finds the remarkable in the commonplace ... This is a beautiful little book: an argument, if ever there was one, for staying home this summer, finding the nearest traffic jam and enjoying it. -- Craig Brown * Mail on Sunday, Book of the Week * Blending history, anthropology and social observation with understated wit, this is a surprisingly compelling portrait of things most of us ignore... Moran changes the way you&#39;ll look at lay-bys, flyovers, road signs - even concrete - forever. -- Clover Stroud * Sunday Telegraph * It isn&#39;t easy to write a love poem to highways, and Moran deserves our thanks for making such a valiant effort. This is a part-bonkers, part-brilliant book, as many of the best books are. -- Jonathan Wright * The Tablet * A very perceptive look at our relationship with motorways -- Sir Christopher Frayling * Daily Telegraph * The optimism and sense of wonder of the era is evoked brilliantly by the academic and cultural historian Joe Moran... Moran&#39;s account is an elegant piece of scholarship, lightened by some engrossing facts... -- Alasdair Reid * Sunday Herald * Books of the Year 2009: Delightful...A beautifully written, funny and original book to place alongside the psychogeographies of Iain Sinclair. -- Harry Eyres * FT * Books of the Year 2009: One of the most surprisingly enjoyable and informative books of the year, a highly original work that playfully alights, in its efforts to reinvest the motorway with meaning, on all sorts of unheralded phenomena, from road kill to the growth of the service station -- Andrew Holgate * The Sunday Times * Books of the Year: [A] fascinating read... full of memorable passages -- Roddy Woomble [singer from Idlewild] * Sunday Herald *</p><h2>The Schmeisser Myth: German Submachine Guns Through Two World Wars</h2><p>The origins of &#34;the Schmeisser myth&#34; can be traced back to the summer of 1940, when an official British Military Intelligence report described the first captured M.P. 38 as a &#34;Parachute troops machine pistol of the Schmeisser type&#34;, while later that year plans were afoot to produce the &#34;9mm Schmeisser Carbine M.P. 38 Parachute Model&#34; at BSA Guns Ltd. in Birmingham. The book begins with a brief history of modern warfare and the technological and strategical developments which led to the first &#34;machine guns&#34;, and the adoption during WWI of Infiltration tactics as a means of surmounting the stagnation of trench warfare. The �lite German and Austrian Sturmtruppen (storm troopers) were soon clamouring for portable rapid-fire weaponry capable of effective close-range striking power, and a new class of military small arm was the result, beginning with the Italian Villar Perosa. Several early German developments culminated in the adoption of the Bergmann M.P. 18,I in 1918. The new term &#34;submachine gun&#34;, coined in America, soon came to denote any light, portable pistol-calibre automatic weapon of the type called a Maschinenpistole in Germany. The M.P. 38 was adopted in 1938 and was superseded by a somewhat simpler version called the MP 40 in 1940. The MP 40 was produced in five manufacturing variations by three firms - ERMA, Haenel, and Steyr - until 1944. Of special interest to advanced collectors will be the four detailed, illustrated accounts of M.P. 38 and MP 40 magazines and loaders, magazine pouches, manuals, and the rare transport and storage chest. This in-depth technical, tactical and historical treatise on these important and iconic weapons and their makers concludes with a Bibliography and an extensive Index</p><p></p><h2>Torture Memos: Rationalizing the Unthinkable</h2><p><p>On April 16, 2009, the Justice Department released never-before-seen secret memos describing, in graphic detail, the brutal interrogation techniques used by the CIA under the Bush administration&#x2019;s &#x201c;war on terror.&#x201d; Now, for the first time, the key documents are compiled in one remarkable volume, showing that the United States government&#x2019;s top attorneys were instrumental in rationalizing acts of torture and cruelty, employing chillingly twisted logic and Orwellian reasoning to authorize what the law absolutely forbids.</p><p>This collection gives readers an unfiltered look at the tactics approved for use in the CIA&#x2019;s secret overseas prisons&#x2014;including forcing detainees to stay awake for eleven days straight, slamming them against walls, stripping them naked, locking them in a small box with insects to manipulate their fears, and, of course, waterboarding&#x2014;and at the incredible arguments advanced to give them a green light.</p><p>Originally issued in secret by the Office of Legal Counsel between 2002 and 2005, the documents collected here have been edited only to eliminate repetition. They reflect, in their own words, the analysis that guided the legal architects of the Bush administration&#x2019;s interrogation policies.</p><p>Renowned legal scholar David Cole&#x2019;s introductory essay tells the story behind the memos, and presents a compelling case that instead of demanding that the CIA conform its conduct to the law, the nation&#x2019;s top lawyers contorted the law to conform to the CIA&#x2019;s abusive and patently illegal conduct. He argues eloquently that official accountability for these legal wrongs is essential if the United States is to restore fidelity to the rule of law.</p></p><p><b>David Cole</b> is a professor of law at Georgetown University, legal affairs correspondent for <i>The Nation</i>, a frequent contributor to the <i>New York Review of Books</i>, and author of the American Book Award-winning <i>Enemy Aliens</i>.

One of its members sleeps the fitful sleep of the guilty, and Wolfe's getting dead-tired of murder.</p><p><b>Rex Stout</b> (1886&#x2013;1975) wrote dozens of short stories, novellas, and full-length mystery novels, most featuring his two indelible characters, the peerless detective Nero Wolfe and his handy sidekick, Archie Goodwin.The magic of Rex Stout's novels is the stark contrast between the pompous, overweight master detective Nero Wolfe and his assistant, smart-aleck playboy Archie Goodwin. It takes a versatile performer to portray both Goodwin, the narrator, and Wolfe, the boss. Unfortunately, Michael Prichard, who has read 20 Stout titles for Audio Partners, isn't such a performer. Prichard has a strong and distinct style marked by wryness and a well-planned pomposity, but his wryness lacks the toughness of Archie's character, and his pomposity is missing the biliousness of the beer-swilling, orchid-raising Wolfe. The story, written in Stout's clever style, has the detectives hired to follow a slippery daughter-in-law.

For him, the challenge of the mountain is what he calls &#34;feeding the rat&#34; - the need to get out, to test yourself and, above all, to have some fun. Although his name is almost unknown to outsiders, he is famous in the climbing world both for his talent as a mountaineer and for his anarchic attitude to the sport. He is adamant that is is not a sport, but a pastime and the main object is to have a good time. He has climbed all over the world - in Britain, the Alps, the Himalayas, the Karakoram, New Zealand, Alaska, the Andes, Patagonia and the South American jungle. A.Alvarez has known Mo since 1964 and climbed with him often and this book includes accounts of two of their near disasters - one in the Dolomites, the other on the Old Man of Hoy.</p><p>Outside the world of mountaineering, few recognize the name of Mo Anthoine, who climbs purely for pleasure, not to set records. Poet and critic Alvarez ( Offshore: A North Sea Journey ) has had the good fortune to climb with Anthoine; here, he offers an affectionate portrait of his unique friend. "Feeding the rat" is Anthoine's term for the challenge of a difficult climb, and he has "fed the rat" in the Alps, the Himalayas, the Karakorum, in Alaska, the Andes and New Zealand. His expertise on rock faces led to a career as cameraman for the BBC and movies. With another climber he designed the Joe Brown helmet that has become standard wear for mountaineers, and he also manufactures waterproof clothing for outdoor activities; but he still finds time to climb. Alvarez recounts spectacular adventures on the high peaks; he describes two of his own climbs with Anthoine, one of them including out-of-practice elders scaling the Old Man of Hoy in the Orkney Islands. This is a charming memoir, splendid for sedentary adventurers.

Her initial objective, to search out and illustrate the glorious flora growing in the tree canopies and along the innumerable waterways of the great rivers of the Amazon basin, was later combined with a growing concern at the commercial plunder of the great forests. Her first expedition to Amazonas was in 1956 and it was then that she began to keep the diaries that, along with her paintings, drawings and sketches, make up this book. Although plant hunting always came first whenever possible and practical, other events often took over. A small dug-out canoe could become a waterlogged, if not dangerous, place to be; rapids had to be got through; recalcitrant boatmen were gently or sternly coerced; drunken prospectors were held off with a revolver. She was fascinated by the rich mix of Brazilians she came across and often lived with for a tim</p><p>Margaret Mee was born in Chesham, Buckinghamshire in 1909. She died tragically in a road accident in Leicestershire in 1988. For more than 35 years she had lived in Brazil with her husband. Soon after her death her name was added to the World Wide Fund for Nature, International Conservation Roll of Honour.British botanical artist and Amazon explorer Margaret Mee (1909-88) recorded her observations with pen and brush. Like a great plant explorer, Mee had a profound affinity for the place, its plants, and its people. In this munificent volume, her graceful and exquisitely detailed paintings of flora and fauna, works that combine both science and art, are accompanied by photographs and her extensive travel journals. Filled with botanical information and tales of adventure and hardship--including boat trouble, feuds, getting lost, and being bitten so fiercely by insects that her eyes swelled shut and she had to wrap her hands in plastic--Mee's travelogues are as riveting as her paintings are beautiful. <i>Donna Seaman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Is it really Donald Trump and a GOP filled with white supremacists? In a major new work of historical revisionism, Dinesh D&#39;Souza makes the provocative case that Democrats are the ones killing America by turning it into a massive nanny state modeled on the Southern plantation system. This sweeping alternative history of the Democratic Party goes back to its foundations in the antebellum South. The slaveholding elite devised the plantation as a means of organizing labor and political support. It was a mini welfare state, a cradle to grave system that bred dependency and punished any urge to independence. This model impressed northern Democrats, inspiring the political machines that traded government handouts for votes from ethnic immigrant blocs. Today&#39;s Democrats have expanded to a multiracial plantation of ghettos for blacks, barrios for Latinos, and reservations for Native Americans. Whites are the only holdouts resisting full dependency, and so they are blamed for the bigotry and racial exploitation that is actually perpetrated by the left. Death of a Nation&#39;s bracing alternative vision of American history explains the Democratic Party&#39;s dark past, reinterprets the roles of figures like Van Buren, FDR and LBJ, and exposes the hidden truth that racism comes not from Trump or the conservative right but rather from Democrats and progressives on the left.</p><p></p><h2>Death Is Stupid (Ordinary Terrible Things)</h2><p><p><strong><em>Death Is Stupid&nbsp;</em>is an invaluable tool for discussing death, but also the possibilities for celebrating life and love.</strong></p> <p>"She's in a better place now," adults say again and again.

This is the book that tells readers how to invest like the man know as &#34;the Wizard of Omaha&#34; (Forbes) and the investor with the Midas Touch. The book focuses on his investing principles and also includes his ideas on common investment fallacies. The Midas Touch follows Buffett&#39;s career through his recent participation in Capital Cities&#39; acquisition of ABC, and includes John Train&#39;s analysis of Buffett&#39;s views on the market outlook. A great addition to the investment reader.</p><p>In The Money Masters , Train captured the investing styles of about 10 highly successful investors. Here he has expanded the 40 pages devoted to Buffett in the earlier book, using much of the same material. This is more of a paean than the earlier work because none of Buffett's "worst" investments are mentioned, and Buffett's reputation has grown. Train writes well, with wit and clarityan amiable match for the style of an investor who shuns computers, won't use a calculator. He examines Buffett's methods and advises the reader how to invest like Buffett. Readers would have benefited from more analysis/biography rather than the 60 pages used to list major transactions of Berkshire Hathaway (the company Buffett controls), but most business collections will want this.

Innocuous remarks suddenly turn damning. Socratic dialogue gives way to heated assault. And the relationship between a somewhat fatuous teacher and his seemingly hapless pupil turns into a fiendishly accurate X ray of the meechanisms of power, censorship, and abuse.</p><p>David Mamet is one of the most distinctive voices on the contemporary American stage.

His screenplays include: The Postman Always Rings Twice, The Verdict, The Untouchables, We&#39;re No Angels and Glengarry Glen Ross; he was writer and director for House of Games, Things Change and Homicide.&#34;An ear for reproducing everyday language has long been David Mamet&#39;s hallmark and he has now employed it to skewer the dogmatic, puritannical streak which has become commonplace on and off the campus. With Oleanna he continues an exploration of male-female conflicts begun with Sexual Perversity in Chicago in 1974. Oleanna cogently demonstrates that when free thought and dialogue are imperilled, nobody wins.&#34; The Independent, Michael Wise &#34;John and Carol go to it with hand-to hand combat that amounts to a primal struggle for power.

Jones is a highly accomplished writer in whose hands such elemental raw materials turn strange and fugitive . . . Though his novels often turn on sudden shocks, the real power of his prose lies in its slow accumulation of energy around dimly apprehended points of tension . . . Part of what's impressive about the book is that it holds its own. One might expect some level of its allusiveness, an acknowledgement of literature's other lost sailors. But Jones's writing has a cool independence, aloof from others' words.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Guardian</i></p><p> </p><p>&#x201c;Charting a course somewhere between <i>Life of Pi</i> and Paul Kingsnorth's <i>Beast</i>, <i>Cove</i> is a minimal, occasionally mysterious, man-versus-the-elements fable . . . there's plenty under the surface of the terse, telegraphic prose. <i>Cove</i> repays attentive parsing.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Observer</i></p><p> </p><p>&#x201c;The writing [is] spare and economical . . . lyrical . . . short and intense.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Sunday Telegraph</i></p><p> </p><p>&#x201c;A narrative as stripped of detail as its protagonist is of his memories, which nonetheless proves curiously powerful.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Sunday (London) Times</i></p><p> </p><p>&#x201c;Jones's brutally, beautifully distilled, almost incantatory language is entirely his own . . .

They must reject everything that is dead and life destroying, and in mutual interchange and joyful response awaken to the life whose source is the dynamic, living God. This is the message of the five addresses given by Bishop John Taylor during the Mission to the University of Oxford early in 1986. In his incomparably graceful and poetic style, the author of The Go-Between God presents a vision of Christian living which will speak to this and future generations. John V.

The slow, lightly armed spy ship came under a withering cannon barrage that killed one and wounded ten, including the captain. At the end of the day, the Pueblo surrendered all her sensitive spying instruments and classified documents without firing a shot, in what may have been one of the greatest intelligence disasters of the last half of the twentieth century. <br>In A Matter of Accountability, author Trevor Armbrister has re-created the amazing events that culminated in the first surrender of a U.S. Navy ship since the War of 1812, from the ship itself-a nearly-defenseless former coastal freighter that frequently had to be hand-steered-to the unheeded warnings from North Korea about U.S. spy ships, to the lack of air support when the ship came under fire. Eleven months later, the North Koreans released the tortured crew after they had signed confessions. Some were nearly blind from starvation. The United States immediately revoked a grudging apology, and started an investigation into what had happened. <br>An initial court of inquiry recommended that the captain be tried in a court martial, but the Secretary of the Navy declined, perhaps fearing what author Trevor Armbrister details in A Matter of Accountability. With over three hundred interviews, starting with the skipper, Commander Lloyd M. (Pete) Bucher, to then-Secretary of Defense Clark Clifford, Armbrister painstakingly reveals every aspect of the appalling behind-the-scenes blunders that made the Pueblo a doomed ship from the very beginning. A Matter of Accountability is a must-read for anyone who has enjoyed Tom Clancy's high-stakes naval thrillers.<br><br><b>TREVOR ARMBRISTER </b>wrote and edited for the Saturday Evening Post and Reader's Digest for more than forty years.

His writing exposes and illumines the wounds that Nazi destructiveness left on language. John Felstiner&#39;s book is a critical biography of Celan. It offers new translations of well-known and little-known poems including a chapter on Celan&#39;s famous &#34;Deathfugue&#34; - plus his speeches, prose fiction and letters. The book also presents photos of the poet and his circle. Drawing on interviews with Celan&#39;s family and friends and his personal library in Normandy and Paris, as well as German commentary, Felstiner tells the poet&#39;s story: his birth in 1920 in Romania, the overnight loss of his parents in a Nazi deportation, his experience of forced labour and Soviet occupation during the war, and then his difficult exile in Paris. The life&#39;s work of Paul Celan emerges through readings of his poems within their personal and historical matrix. At the same time Felstiner finds insights by opening up the very process of translating Celan&#39;s poems To present this poetry and the strain of Jewishness it displays, Felstiner uncovers Celan&#39;s sources in the Bible and Judaic mysticism, his affinities with Kafka, Heine, Holderlin, Rilke and Nelly Sachs, his fascination with Heidegger and Buber, his translations of Shakespeare, Dickinson, Mandelshtram, Apollinaire. First and last, Felstiner explores the achievement of a poet surviving in his mother tongue, the German language that had passed, Celan said, &#34;through the thousand darknesses of deathbringing speech.&#34;</p><p>Celan (1920-70) is one of the great poets of this century. His world reputation rests on two aspects: he is a major German poet, and he is the preeminent poet of the destruction of European Jewish life. Felstiner's (English and Jewish studies, Stanford Univ.) literary biography is an engagement with Celan as a man and as a poet. His descriptions of the allusions and the translation problems of the great poems "Death Fugue," "The Vintagers," "Tenebrae," and "Stretto" are models of sympathetic reading. Celan's work as a translator (especially of Osip Mandelstam) and his friendship with Nelly Sachs are given the importance they are due. The difficult and hermetic late poems are worked through carefully. Celan was a successor to Holderlin as a German poet, and as a Jewish poet he was influenced by Buber's ideas of redemption through history and language. Celan killed himself in 1970.

In a lighthearted, slapstick story just right for Halloween, Baldrick is learning to be a witch's cat. He's not that good at riding a broomstick, but he's really skilled at spells and incantations. What he loves most are mice. When he hears that the moon is made of green cheese, he's determined to get there because he knows that "where there's cheese, there's mice." Messing with the witch's brew, he's clashingly transformed into a strange creature, part bee, part pig, and makes a beeline for the moon. The moon mice turn out to be "enormice," but he narrowly escapes them and proves himself a hero. The silly whimsy gets a bit much at times, but the wordplay is funny, and the brightly colored, detailed illustrations combine farce, domesticity, and general garish fun. The witch, with long, gray permed hair, high-heeled boots, swirling cape, and pointed hat, is a satisfying blend of the trendy, the ancient, and the hideous. <i>Hazel Rochman</i></p><h2>The Rolling Stone Interviews, 1967-1980: Talking with the Legends of Rock &amp; Roll</h2><p>Some rock journalism celebrates rock's vivid personalities and their life styles; some rock journalism explores musical tradition and the meaning of rock &amp; roll as a cultural fact and force. The best rock journalism, the classic Rolling Stone kind, pursues both paths. The Rolling stone Interviews are the quintessence of the best. For in the Interviews, the premier rock artists themselves are drawn out by the most knowledgeable and skillful of the journalists to talk articulately, frankly, and in great depth about themselves, each other, their music, their lives, our lives and times. This collection of the best of the Interviews, newly edited and with commentary by the editors of Rolling Stone, is the ultimate history of rock &amp; roll as understood and told by the people who made it and made it big--the legends of rock &amp; roll. The Legends: Chuck Berry, Johnny Cash, Ray Charles, Eric Clapton, Donovan, Bob dylan, Jerry Garcia, Mick Jagger, Billy Joel, Elton oh, G. B.

She lives in Seattle with her husband and young son.<i>Excerpted from the Hardcovoer Edition</i><br><b>Killer App</b><br><br>Sam Elling was filling out his online dating profile and trying to decide whether to laugh or cry. On the one hand, he had just described himself as &#x201c;quick to laugh&#x201d; and had answered the question, &#x201c;How macho do you consider yourself?&#x201d; eight on a scale of ten. But on the other hand, the whole thing was really quite frustrating, and no one, he knew, ever admitted to anything less than an eight on the masculinity scale anyway. Sam was trying to come up with five things he couldn&#x2019;t live without. He knew that many would-be daters cheekily wrote: air, food, water, shelter, plus something else vaguely amusing. (He was thinking Swiss cheese would be a clever addition to that list, or possibly vitamin D, though since he was in Seattle, he seemed, in fact, to be living quite nicely without it.) He could go the techie route&#x2014;laptop, other laptop, tablet, wifi connection, iPhone&#x2014;but they&#x2019;d think he was a computer geek. Never mind that he was; he didn&#x2019;t want them to know that right away. He could go the sentimental route&#x2014;framed photo from parents&#x2019; wedding, grandfather&#x2019;s lucky penny, program from his star turn in his middle school production of Grease, acceptance letter to MIT, first mix tape ever made for him by a girl&#x2014;but he suspected that would belie his reported macho factor. He could go the lactose route: Swiss cheese again (he was clearly craving Swiss cheese for no apparent reason) plus chocolate ice cream, cream cheese, Pagliacci&#x2019;s pizza, and double tall lattes. It wasn&#x2019;t really true though. He could live without those; he just wouldn&#x2019;t like it very much.<br><br>The point was this exercise was five things: annoying, prying, cloying, embarrassing, and totally pointless. He didn&#x2019;t have any hobbies because he worked all the time which was the reason he couldn&#x2019;t find a date. If he didn&#x2019;t work all the time (or weren&#x2019;t a software engineer and so also worked with some women), he would have time for hobbies he could list, but then he wouldn&#x2019;t need to because he wouldn&#x2019;t need online dating in order to meet people. Yes, he was a computer geek, but he was also, he thought, smart and funny and reasonably good-looking. He just didn&#x2019;t have five hobbies or five witty things he couldn&#x2019;t live without or five interesting things on his bedside table (truthful answer would have been: half-full water glass, quarter-full water glass, empty water glass, crumpled used Kleenex, crumpled used Kleenex) or five revealing hopes for the future (never to have to do this again, repeat times five). Nor did he care about anyone else&#x2019;s reported hobbies or five requirements for life, bedside tables, or futures. He had already answered variations of these inane questions with another service, dated their dates, and saw what all of this nonsense came to. It came to nonsense. If you picked the ones who seemed pretty down-to-earth (books, writing implement, reading lamp, clock radio, cell phone), you got boring. If you picked the ones who seemed eccentric (yellow rain hat, Polaroid camera, lime seltzer, photo of Gertrude Stein, plastic model of Chairman Mao), you got really weird and full of themselves. If you picked the one who seemed like a good fit (&#x201c;Laptop and honestly nothing else because that has all I need&#x201d;), you got a computer geek so much like your college roommate that you wondered if he&#x2019;d had an unconvincing sex change operation without telling you. So you had your pick of boring, weird, or Trevor Anderson.<br><br>Five things Sam couldn&#x2019;t live without: sarcasm, mockery, scorn, derision, cynicism.<br><br>That was not the whole picture, of course. If it were, he wouldn&#x2019;t be online dating. He would be holed up in a basement apartment somewhere contentedly crotchety on his own (Xbox, Wii, PlayStation, fifty-two-inch plasma flat-screen, microwave nachos). Instead, he was putting himself out there again. Did this not indicate optimism re: love? (hope, good cheer, warmth, generosity, the promise of someone to kiss good night). Maybe, but it was way too cheesy to write on the stupid form.<br><br>The problem with the stupid form was this: it wasn&#x2019;t just that people didn&#x2019;t tell the truth&#x2014;though they didn&#x2019;t. It was that there was no way to tell the truth, even if you wanted to. Things on a bedside table do not reveal a soul. Hopes for the future cannot be distilled for forms or strangers. Fill-in-the-blank questions are fun but not really indicative of the long-term future of a relationship. (They aren&#x2019;t really that fun either.) Even the stuff with straightforward answers fails to reveal what you need to know. For instance, Sam wanted to date a woman who could and would cook and enjoy it, but it couldn&#x2019;t be because she was some kind of domestic goddess who required a clean house all the time (Sam was not neat), and it couldn&#x2019;t be because she believed a woman&#x2019;s place was in the home and she should cater to her man (Sam was a feminist), and it couldn&#x2019;t be because she was one of those people who ate only organic, sustainable, locally grown, chemical-free, ecologically responsible, whole, raw, vegan food (see above re: Sam&#x2019;s love of dairy). It had to be because Sam didn&#x2019;t cook and she did and they both needed to eat, and he would take on some other household chore like dish washing or clothes folding or bathroom scrubbing in exchange. There was no place for all that on the form or even a place to indicate that he was the kind of man who considered such bizarre minutiae relevant.<br><br>And yet, a man has needs. And not the ones you think. Well, those too, but they weren&#x2019;t foremost on Sam&#x2019;s mind. Foremost on Sam&#x2019;s mind was it would be nice to have someone to go out to dinner with on Friday nights and to wake up with on Saturday mornings and to go with him to museums and movies and plays and parties and restaurants and ball games and on long weekends away, day hikes, ski trips, parental visits, wine tastings, and work functions. It was this last which was especially pressing for Sam, who worked at the online dating company whose form was causing him so much grief. It employed many swank and high-powered people&#x2014;most of them male&#x2014;who brought many swank and high-powered people&#x2014;most of them female&#x2014;to their many swank and high-powered black-tie galas. Sam did not own a tie of any color until he got this job, was himself neither swank nor high-powered, and felt strongly that a job as a software engineer in a three-walled cubicle surrounded by other software engineers with their obscure math T-shirts and Star Trek action figures and seven-sided Rubik&#x2019;s cubes should have absolved him from these sorts of work pressures. But the lawyers and VPs and CFOs and VIPs and investors wrecked the curve, and besides, it was an online dating company&#x2014;showing up to these functions solo was a bad career move. Sam spent these evenings in his too-stiff tuxedo making awkward private jokes with his awkward single software engineering compatriots, sipping free vodka tonics and worrying that he&#x2019;d never find true love.<br><br>In high school in Baltimore, when Holly Palentine saw through his geeky exterior to the cool heart that beat beneath and agreed first to dance with him at homecoming and then to let him take her to dinner and a movie and then to hang out in his basement most afternoons after school making out, Sam had assumed he would marry his high school sweetheart. He remembered dancing close with her at the spring formal and imagining what they&#x2019;d look like on their wedding day. Then she sent him a letter from the Girl Scout camp where she was a counselor asking if they could still be friends. Still? Sam hadn&#x2019;t realized this had ever been in question. In college at MIT, he had tried late-night hookups in the dorm and girls who flirted with him at parties and falling madly in love with the barista at Shot Through the Heart (though he had not tried talking to her) and a year-and-a-half real, adult relationship with Della Bassette, who then graduated and left for three years of volunteer corps in Zimbabwe, and another year and a half of true rock-solid start-thinking-about-engagement-rings love with Jenny O&#x2019;Dowd, who really did love him and want to be with him forever except she accidentally also hooked up with his roommate the semester before graduation. Twice. Then Sam tried being alone, being alone far less likely to result in the crushing of his soul and atom-splitting of his heart. He tried not caring and not risking and not looking, hanging out with guy friends, solo vacations, self-growth, and canceling cable. None of that worked either. Not being in love did mean he was less likely to get hurt. But he honestly didn&#x2019;t see the point.<br><br>He didn&#x2019;t see the point not because he was one of those people who always, always had to be paired up, and not because he didn&#x2019;t think of himself as whole without a partner, and not because otherwise it was too hard to have sex, but because when he wasn&#x2019;t spending time with people he loved, Sam found he was spending a lot of time with people he didn&#x2019;t. His work colleagues were fine at work, but they didn&#x2019;t have much to talk about when they went out afterward. Happy hour with friends he&#x2019;d lost touch with since college reminded him why he&#x2019;d lost touch with them. Small talk at parties held by friends of friends meant a lot of pretending to think interesting a lot of things he didn&#x2019;t think were interesting.<br><br>When he left the East Coast for Seattle, Sam tried internet dating and couldn&#x2019;t believe he&#x2019;d been alive for thirty-two and a half years and never thought to before. Sam believed in computers and programming, in codable information, in algorithms and numbers and logic. His father was also a software engineer as well as a computer science professor at Johns Hopkins University, so Sam was raised to believe: computers were his religion. Everyone else pitched online dating as the only option after not meeting anyone in the vast ocean of college. But Sam liked online dating because it took away the mystery. Maybe you met someone and liked her and she liked you and you hit it off and you started dating and that went pretty well and you got closer and closer, shared more and more, starting building lives around each other, fell deeply in love, and still she slept with your roommate when you went home for the weekend. Computers would never allow for such outlying variance.<br><br>Online dating had yet to work for Sam. But it did pay well. And that came in a close second as it turned out. One too-pretty-to-go-to-work morning in June, Sam&#x2019;s whole team got a sheepish text from their boss. &#x201c;Fair warning,&#x201d; Jamie wrote. &#x201c;BB&#x2019;s agenda for OOF today: Quantify the Human Heart.&#x201d; Jamie referred to the company&#x2019;s enormously important CEO, his boss&#x2019;s boss, as BB. Sam loved him for this. BB had recently decreed that each team would begin every morning with a stand-up meeting, the idea being that the company wasn&#x2019;t wasting its brilliant programmers&#x2019; time with a real meeting but only a brief encounter in the hallway. Generally, this meant it was the length of an actual meeting but without the comfort of chairs and a Danish. Jamie therefore called it OOF, theoretically for On Our Feet, though actually for how those feet felt at the end of the meeting. Sam loved Jamie for this too. Also because he wasn&#x2019;t a superstickler for punctuality, which gave Sam time to run back inside his apartment and change into more comfortable shoes.<br><br>&#x201c;So here&#x2019;s the story,&#x201d; Jamie began when Sam got there. &#x201c;BB thinks we need a better bottom line. Some online matchmaking sites promise &#x2018;most fun dates.&#x2019; Some boast &#x2018;highest percentage of marriages.&#x2019; BB wants to up the ante. Too many dates end in failure. Too many marriages end in divorce. What&#x2019;s better than dating and better than marriage?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Friends with benefits?&#x201d; guessed Nigel from Australia.<br><br>&#x201c;Soul mates,&#x201d; said Jamie. &#x201c;BB wants an algorithm that will find your soul mate. Therefore I turn to you. Love is a tricky thing. All that human variable. The soul is not logical. The heart wants what the heart wants. Hard to nail down. Hard to quantify and program. But we are computer programmers, and this is our job. So we must. Tell me how.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Increase the odds of getting laid,&#x201d; said Nigel. &#x201c;Looser dates lead to more and earlier hooking up. The farther you go on a first date, the more information you have about sexual compatibility.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Won&#x2019;t work,&#x201d; objected Rajiv from New Delhi. &#x201c;Dating sucks.&#x201d; On this, the software engineers, save Nigel, were in agreement.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not fun,&#x201d; said Gaurav from Mumbai.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s very awkward,&#x201d; said Arnab from Assam.<br><br>&#x201c;And it&#x2019;s all lies,&#x201d; said Jayaraj from Chennai. Five Indian states Sam had become an expert on since beginning work as a software engineer: Delhi, Assam, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal. &#x201c;You are so much worse on a date than you are in real life,&#x201d; Jayaraj continued. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t string two sentences together without sounding like some kind of idiot. You stammer and bring up awkward topics and embarrass yourself a lot. You&#x2019;re not really like that in real life.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Or you present yourself as better than you really are,&#x201d; Sam added, &#x201c;which is also a lie. You get all dressed up and do your hair and put on makeup when really you&#x2019;re going to walk around the house in yoga clothes and a scrunchie all day.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Makeup?&#x201d; Jamie raised an eyebrow at him.<br><br>&#x201c;Scrunchie?&#x201d; wondered Jayaraj.<br><br>&#x201c;We need a third party,&#x201d; offered Arnab, &#x201c;like the Hindu astrologers who know everyone in the village for generations and thus make marriages at birth that last until death.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Many cultures have matchmakers. Japanese nakodos. Jewish shadchens.&#x201d; Gaurav had been an anthropology major at UC Santa Cruz. &#x201c;There are aeons of precedent. They realize a truth.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Which is?&#x201d; asked Jamie.<br><br>&#x201c;Who people think they are and what people think they want is not really who they are or what they want,&#x201d; said Gaurav sagely. &#x201c;Wise and sometimes magical elders set you up based on who you really are and who would be good for you instead.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I have no magical elders,&#x201d; said Jamie.<br><br>&#x201c;No, you have something better,&#x201d; said Sam. &#x201c;Computer programmers. We could dig a little deeper into the data users provide. See what it says about them rather than what they say about themselves.&#x201d;<br><br>Everyone&#x2019;s feet were getting tired, so digging deeper seemed worth a shot. &#x201c;Accusing our customers of lying,&#x201d; Jamie said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure BB will love it.&#x201d;<br><br>Sam stopped for coffee on the way back to his desk. (Five places within seven hundred feet of Sam&#x2019;s desk to get a world-class double tall latte: the espresso stand on the second floor, the espresso stand on the fourteenth floor, the cafeteria, the coffee shop in the lobby of the Fifth Avenue entrance, the coffee shop in the lobby of the Fourth Avenue entrance. Sam loved Seattle.) Then he sat down and considered where, if not on online dating forms, people revealed the truth about themselves. He messaged Jamie: &#x201c;Can I have access to clients&#x2019; financial records?&#x201d;<br><br>Jamie wrote back right away. &#x201c;Accusing our customers of lying and invading their privacy. BB&#x2019;s going to love that too.&#x201d;<br><br>First surefire proof Sam had that users were lying about themselves: everyone everywhere was always having a fit over internet privacy concerns, but promise to find them love or at least sex, and they signed access to their financial records, credit card statements, e-mail accounts, and everything else over to Sam just because he asked nicely. There he saw them not as they represented themselves but as they really were. He saw that they said their five favorite foods were organic blueberries, wheatgrass smoothies, red quinoa, tempeh Reubens, and beluga caviar, but they spent an average of $47.40 a month last year at the 7-Eleven. He saw that the five things they listed on their nightstand were all foreign film DVDs, but they saw Shrek Forever After in 3-D...</p><h2>Top 10 Barcelona: 2018 (Pocket Travel Guide)</h2><p><p>This newly updated pocket travel guide for Barcelona will lead you straight to the best attractions the city has to offer, whether you want to visit Antoni Gaud�'s masterpieces&#x2014;from La Sagrada Familia to Casa Batll�&#x2014;stroll along La Rambla, or have an authentic flamenco show experience.</p><p>True to its name, <b><i>DK Eyewitness Travel Guide: Top 10 Barcelona</i></b> covers all the city's major sights and attractions in easy-to-use "top 10" lists that help you plan the vacation that's right for you.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Itineraries help you plan your trip. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Top 10 lists feature off-the-beaten-track ideas, along with standbys like the top attractions, shopping, dining options, and more. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Comprehensive laminated pull-out map includes color-coded design, public transportation maps, and street indexes. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Maps of walking routes show you the best ways to maximize your time. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Additional maps marked with sights from the guidebook are shown on inside cover flaps, with selected street index and metro map. <br><p>DK's famous full-color photography and museum floor plans, along with just the right amount of coverage of the city's history and culture, provide inspiration as you explore.

Their life is, to say the least, unconventional. Frank&#39;s mother abandoned them years ago: his elder brother Eric is confined to a psychiatric hospital; and his father measures out his eccentricities on an imperial scale. Frank has turned to strange acts of violence to vent his frustrations. In the bizarre daily rituals there is some solace. But when news comes of Eric&#39;s escape from the hospital Frank has to prepare the ground for his brother&#39;s inevitable return - an event that explodes the mysteries of the past and changes Frank utterly. Iain Banks&#39; celebrated first novel is a work of extraordinary originality, imagination and horrifying compulsion: horrifying, because it enters a mind whose realities are not our own, whose values of life and death are alien to our society; and compulsive, because the humour and compassion of that mind reach out to us all.</p><p><i>"I had been making the rounds of the Sacrifice Poles the day we heard my brother had escaped. I already knew something was going to happen; the Factory told me."</i> <p> Those lines begin one of the most infamous of contemporary Scottish novels. The narrator, Frank Cauldhame, is a weird teenager who lives on a tiny island connected to mainland Scotland by a bridge. He maintains grisly Sacrifice Poles to serve as his early warning system and deterrent against anyone who might invade his territory.</p><p> Few novelists have ever burst onto the literary scene with as much controversy as Iain Banks in 1984. <i>The Wasp Factory</i> was reviled by many reviewers on account of its violence and sadism, but applauded by others as a new and <i>Scottish</i> voice--that is, a departure from the English literary tradition. The controversy is a bit puzzling in retrospect, because there is little to object to in this novel, if you're familiar with genre horror.</p><p> <i>The Wasp Factory</i> is distinguished by an authentically felt and deftly written first-person style, delicious dark humor, a sense of the surreal, and a serious examination of the psyche of a childhood psychopath. Most readers will find that they sympathize with and even like Frank, despite his three murders (each of which is hilarious in an Edward Gorey fashion). It's a classic of contemporary horror. <i>--Fiona Webster</i></p>Iain Banks came to widespread and controversial public notice with the publication of his first novel, THE WASP FACTORY, in 1984. He has been a hugely popular writer of fiction ever since, and, as Iain M Banks, of science fiction.</p><h2>Strike It Rich with Pocket Change: Error Coins Bring Big Money</h2><p><b>That odd-looking coin could be worth a fortune!</b><br><br>Mistakes happen.

Gordon, author of a biography of Virginia Woolf and Shared Lives (1992), achieves some remarkable eloquence herself as she dismantles once and for all the image of Charlotte Bront{&#x2030;}e as a figure of pathos and presents, instead, a courageous survivor, a determined writer, and a woman of volcanic emotion. Small, tough, and unfashionable, Bront{&#x2030;}e lived on after her mother and her five siblings, including fellow writers Emily and Anne, succumbed to illness and death. As the physical world betrayed her, Bront{&#x2030;}e turned to the life of the mind and the revitalizing power of words. Gordon, as skilled at literary analysis as at chronicling a life, approaches Bront{&#x2030;}e's tragic and enduringly relevant story from several angles, carefully identifying all the autobiographical elements of her novels and contrasting her commitment to writing and her independent spirit to her era's strict and pitiless code of behavior for women. Gordon also examines the gestalt of Bront{&#x2030;}e's unusual family, her painful relationships with men, and her decision, at the peak of her success, to choose life over art and marry, a choice followed all too soon by her premature death. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We do in Life and Business</h2><p>Groundbreaking new research shows that by grabbing hold of the three-step "loop" all habits form in our brains--cue, routine, reward--we can change them, giving us the power to take control over our lives.<br><b>&nbsp;</b><br>"We are what we repeatedly do," said Aristotle. "Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit." On the most basic level, a habit is a simple neurological loop: there is a cue (my mouth feels gross), a routine (hello, Crest), and a reward (ahhh, minty fresh). Understanding this loop is the key to exercising regularly or becoming more productive at work or tapping into reserves of creativity. Marketers, too, are learning how to exploit these loops to boost sales; CEOs and coaches are using them to change how employees work and athletes compete. As this book shows, tweaking even one habit, as long as it's the right one, can have staggering effects.<br>&nbsp;<br>In <b>The Power of Habit</b>, award-winning <i>New York Times </i>business reporter Charles Duhigg takes readers inside labs where brain scans record habits as they flourish and die; classrooms in which students learn to boost their willpower; and boardrooms where executives dream up products that tug on our deepest habitual urges. Full of compelling narratives that will appeal to fans of Michael Lewis, Jonah Lehrer, and Chip and Dan Heath, <b>The Power of Habit</b><i> </i>contains an exhilarating argument: our most basic actions are not the product of well-considered decision making, but of habits we often do not realize exist. By harnessing this new science, we can transform our lives.</p><p><p><b>Q&amp;A with Charles Duhigg</b></p> <p><strong>Q. What sparked your interest in habits? </strong></p> <p>A. I first became interested in the science of habits eight years ago, as a newspaper reporter in Baghdad, when I heard about an army major conducting an experiment in a small town named Kufa. The major had analyzed videotapes of riots and had found that violence was often preceded by a crowd of Iraqis gathering in a plaza and, over the course of hours, growing in size. Food vendors would show up, as well as spectators. Then, someone would throw a rock or a bottle.</p> <p>When the major met with Kufa&#x2019;s mayor, he made an odd request: Could they keep food vendors out of the plazas? Sure, the mayor said. A few weeks later, a small crowd gathered near the Great Mosque of Kufa. It grew in size. Some people started chanting angry slogans. At dusk, the crowd started getting restless and hungry. People looked for the kebab sellers normally filling the plaza, but there were none to be found. The spectators left. The chanters became dispirited. By 8 p.m., everyone was gone.</p> <p>I asked the major how he had figured out that removing food vendors would change peoples' behavior.</p> <p>The U.S. military, he told me, is one of the biggest habit-formation experiments in history. &#x201c;Understanding habits is the most important thing I&#x2019;ve learned in the army,&#x201d; he said. By the time I got back to the U.S., I was hooked on the topic.</p> <p><strong>Q. How have your own habits changed as a result of writing this book?</strong></p> <p>A. Since starting work on this book, I've lost about 30 pounds, I run every other morning (I'm training for the NY Marathon later this year), and I'm much more productive. And the reason why is because I've learned to diagnose my habits, and how to change them.</p> <p>Take, for instance, a bad habit I had of eating a cookie every afternoon. By learning how to analyze my habit, I figured out that the reason I walked to the cafeteria each day wasn't because I was craving a chocolate chip cookie. It was because I was craving socialization, the company of talking to my colleagues while munching. That was the habit's real reward. And the cue for my behavior - the trigger that caused me to automatically stand up and wander to the cafeteria, was a certain time of day.</p> <p>So, I reconstructed the habit: now, at about 3:30 each day, I absentmindedly stand up from my desk, look around for someone to talk with, and then gossip for about 10 minutes. I don't even think about it at this point. It's automatic. It's a habit. I haven't had a cookie in six months.</p> <p><strong>Q. What was the most surprising use of habits that you uncovered?</strong></p> <p>A. The most surprising thing I've learned is how companies use the science of habit formation to study - and influence - what we buy.</p> <p>Take, for example, Target, the giant retailer. Target collects all kinds of data on every shopper it can, including whether you&#x2019;re married and have kids, which part of town you live in, how much money you earn, if you've moved recently, the websites you visit. And with that information, it tries to diagnose each consumer&#x2019;s unique, individual habits.</p> <p>Why? Because Target knows that there are these certain moments when our habits become flexible. When we buy a new house, for instance, or get married or have a baby, our shopping habits are in flux. A well-timed coupon or advertisement can convince us to buy in a whole new way. But figuring out when someone is buying a house or getting married or having a baby is tough. And if you send the advertisement after the wedding or the baby arrives, it&#x2019;s usually too late.</p> <p>So Target studies our habits to see if they can predict major life events. And the company is very, very successful. Oftentimes, they know what is going on in someone's life better than that person's parents.</p>CHARLES DUHIGG is an investigative reporter for <i>The New York Times</i>.

A hissing tide of resentment roiled deep inside him, threatening to drown him. Clenching his fists at his sides, Stephen conquered the turmoil within. Through deliberately blank eyes, he looked at King Henry VIII.<br><br>"My liege," he said, blowing stiffly, inhaling the scent of dried lavender and bergamot from the sachets in the bed hangings. By the time he straightened up, the king's attendants had arrived to groom their sovereign for the day.<br><br>"Ah, Wimberleigh." The king put out his arms as an attendant scurried forward and helped him don a loose silk jacket. Henry smiled. In that smile there lingered yet a hint of the old charm, the derring-do of a golden young prince. A prince whom Stephen, as a boy, had idolized as the second Arthur.<br><br>The legendary Arthur had died young, in a blaze of glory. Henry had made the mistake of living on into the corrupt mediocrity of middle age.<br><br>"Come, come," said Henry, beckoning. He swung his swollen legs over the side of the bed and pushed his pale feet into a pair of brocade slippers held by a kneeling servant. "You may approach the royal bed. See what I've found you."<br><br>As he crossed the huge room, Stephen felt the searing curiosity of the sovereign's attendants. By now the chamber was crowded with titled gentlemen, all engaged to supervise the most intimate bodily functions of the king&#x2014;and also to influence the policies of the realm.<br><br>Sir Lambert Wilmeth, groom of the stool, took His Majesty's bowel movements as seriously as Scottish border disputes. Lord Harold Blodsmoor, surveyor of the wardrobe, regarded the king's collection of shoes as highly as the crown jewels. Yet at the moment, the attention of these great gentlemen burned into Stephen de Lacey.<br><br>The girl smiled shyly and even managed to summon an artful blush. She stretched with catlike grace, a bare shoulder emerging from the bedclothes. Like most of the king's mistresses, she took a perverse pride in sharing the bed of the sovereign.<br><br>After so many betrayals, Stephen should have known better than to trust the king. Should have known that the summons could only mean more petty cruelty.<br><br>"I was feeling frisky today." Henry's grin held both mischief and subtle rancor. Limping slightly, he went to the royal stool, speaking over his shoulder as he relieved himself. "I decided to exercise the droit du seigneur&#x2014; again. An antiquated notion, to be sure, but one that has its merits and deserves to be revived from time to time. Now, make a gracious greeting to your lady Gwenyth, and then we'll&#x2014;"<br><br>"Sire," Stephen broke in, heedless of the gasps from the noblemen present. No one interrupted the king. In the thirty years of his reign, Henry VIII had put men to death for lesser offenses.<br><br>Instantly Stephen regretted the risk he had taken. With that one blurted word he might have jeopardized everything.<br><br>"Yes?" The king seemed only mildly annoyed as his gentlemen helped him into doublet and hose. "What is it, Wimberleigh?"<br><br>Stephen couldn't help himself. A killing rage rose like a fountain of fire inside him. "To hell with your droit du seigneur."<br><br>He turned on his heel and strode from the Royal Bedchamber. Though well aware of the infraction he was committing, he could not be a willing player in the familiar, vicious diversion that so delighted Henry.<br><br>The red-and-white livery of the king's Welsh yeomen passed in a blur as Stephen strode out into the paved central court. Seeking a place to cool his temper in private, he stalked into a walled garden. A pebbled path led him through tortured little plots of whitethorn and sweetbriar. The flower beds had been arranged geometrically, so that they resembled rather coarse mosaics.<br><br>Stephen wished for the hundredth time that he had ignored the king's annual summons and stayed in Wiltshire.<br><br>But to refuse the command was to risk the one thing Stephen would kill to safeguard. If the price of keeping his secret was to have his heart ripped out and his pride publicly shredded, then so be it.<br><br>His conviction that the king hadn't finished with him proved correct, for an hour later, a haughty majordomo summoned him to the Presence Chamber.<br><br>An open-timbered ceiling arched high over the hall. The watery sunlight of early spring streamed in through twin banks of mullioned windows. Colored glass made a shifting, jeweled pattern on the walls and floor. Somewhere, an unseen lute player strummed softly, the shimmering music a sweet undercurrent to the murmur of voices.<br><br>Members of the Privy Council stood by, sharp eyed, their shoulders hunched beneath heavy, long robes.<br><br>Stephen paced over the smooth flagstones to the gold-and-scarlet-draped dais. There he stopped, swept his satin-lined cloak back over one shoulder, and sank into a formal obeisance. Even without looking at the king, he knew Henry relished the submissive pose of a man of Stephen's height. Henry took pleasure in anything that made Stephen feel smaller.<br><br>He rose with hatred and defiance clear in his eyes, and a gift in his extended hands.<br><br>Henry sat upon his massive carved chair, looking like Bacchus clad in silver and gold. In recent years, his face had grown as large as a haunch of beef.<br><br>"What's this?" he asked, nodding to a page. The lad took the small wooden coffer from Stephen and offered it to the king. With childlike haste, Henry opened it and extracted a tiny watch on a golden chain. "Marry, my lord, you never fail to amaze me."<br><br>"A trinket, no more," Stephen said in a flat, dead voice. Henry had many appetites, most of them insatiable. Satisfying his craving for unique gifts was no challenge.<br><br>Henry slipped the chain through the baldric that encircled his ample girth. "I assume the design is original."<br><br>Stephen nodded.<br><br>"You've a rare talent for inventions of all sorts, Wim-berleigh. A pity you are so lacking in plain manners." The breadth of his cheeks made his eyes look beady, his mouth thin lipped and tight. "You left the Royal Bedchamber without begging leave, my lord."<br><br>"So I did, sire."<br><br>Henry's hand, pudgy and sparkling with rings, smacked down on the arm of his chair. His fingers strangled a carved gargoyle. "Damn your eyes, Wimberleigh. Must you always breach the limits of propriety and decorum?"<br><br>"Only when provoked, sire."<br><br>The king's expression did not change, yet his small bright eyes took fire. "Has it never occurred to you," he asked in a soft, deadly voice, "that you might do better to dance with your betrothed rather than with my patience? Lady Gwenyth is beautiful. She's well-bred and reasonably wealthy."<br><br>"She is also ruined, sire."<br><br>"I did honor to the wench," Henry snapped. "There is only one king of England, just as there is only one sun. My favor is not for one alone."<br><br>Stephen bit his tongue to stop himself from responding. It was useless to quarrel with a man who likened himself to a heavenly body. He could satisfy his every whim all too easily, for what sane man or woman would dare refuse him?<br><br>"For God's sake, Stephen," Henry thundered, "your evasiveness bedevils me. I've found you four eligible ladies in the past year, and you've refused them all. What is it that makes you so much better than any other noble?"<br><br>"I do not wish to marry again," Stephen stated. He could not resist adding, "My favor is for no one, not even that silly Welsh comfit I found in your bed."<br><br>"Comfits are sweet and agreeable to the palate," Henry pointed out.<br><br>"Aye, but when handled by too many fingers, they lose their savor. And when left long enough to themselves, they rot."<br><br>Without taking his eyes off Stephen, the king held out his hand. A servitor stepped forward and placed in it a silver cup of sack. Henry drank deeply of the Canary wine, then said, "Ah. Still you pine for your Margaret, now seven years cold."<br><br>With all that he was, Stephen resisted the urge to bury his fist in his sovereign's face. How blithely Henry spoke of Meg&#x2014;as if he had never even known her at all.<br><br>"Was she so very dear to you, then," the king went on, twisting the knife, "that you cannot love another?"<br><br>Stephen held himself motionless as his mind filled with memories of Meg. Peeking at him timidly from behind her veil on their wedding day. Weeping in pain and fear in their marriage bed. Hiding her secrets from the husband who adored her. Dying in a sea of blood and bitter curses.<br><br>"Margaret was&#x2014;" Stephen cleared his throat"&#x2014;a child. Gullible. Easily impressed." With terrible, blade-sharp guilt, he knew he had forced her into womanhood and then into motherhood. And finally and most unforgivably, into death.<br><br>"I know well what it is to mourn a wife," Henry said, an unexpected note of sympathy in his voice. Stephen knew he was thinking of quiet, dutiful Jane Seymour, who had died giving the king the one gift he craved above all others: a male heir to the throne.<br><br>"However," Henry continued, imperious again, "a wife is a necessary ornament to a man's station, and old memories should not make you balk at duty. Now. As to the Welsh lady&#x2014;"<br><br>"Sire, I humbly beg your pardon." He dropped his voice so only the king could hear. "I will not take any man's leavings&#x2014;not even those of the king of England. I'll not be a salve to your conscience."<br><br>"My conscience?" Henry's mouth curved into a cold sickle of amusement. His voice was a whisper meant for Stephen alone. "My dear lord of Wimberleigh, where on earth did you get the notion that I had one?"<br><br>Stephen's neck tingled. He reminded himself that Henry VIII had put aside his first wife and brought about the execution of the second. He had appropriated the authority of the church, taken possession of monasteries, driven the poor from their lands. The mere ruining of a young virgin would hardly trouble a man like Henry Tudor.<br><br>"My mistake," Stephen replied softly. "But never mind, the Lady Gwenyth would not want me anyway."<br><br>"Ah, your tarnished reputation," Henry said, waving his now-empty cup. "Wild revels, gambling and rapine. The gossip does find its way to court. Marry, sir, every maiden in the realm quails in fright at the very thought of you."<br><br>Stephen preferred it that way. He had worked hard to hide his few good qualities beneath a patina of ill repute. "I am a man of low morals. An unfortunate flaw in my character. And now if it please Your Majesty, I must withdraw from court."<br><br>With a swiftness that belied his age and bulk, the king came out of his chair. His thick-fingered hand closed in the front of Stephen's quilted doublet. "By God, it does <em>not </em>please me." He put his face very close to Stephen's, so close that Stephen could smell the warm sweetness of sack on his breath. "Get you a wife, Wimberleigh, and then get you a proper heir, else all of England will know what you hide at your Wiltshire estate."<br><br>An animal roar of denial surged to Stephen's throat. With an effort born of years of iron control, he forced himself to keep from tearing into the royal face. How Henry had come to know Stephen's terrible secret was a mystery; how he intended to use the knowledge was becoming painfully obvious.<br><br>With a will, Stephen expelled his breath slowly and stepped back. The king no longer gripped him, yet the hold lingered invisibly&#x2014;would linger until Stephen shed himself once and for all of the king's ire.<br><br>"To your knees, Wimberleigh."<br><br>His cheeks on fire with rage, Stephen sank down.<br><br>"Now swear it. Let me hear you vow that you will obey me." The king's voice rang loud. "Let me hear that you will wed&#x2014;if not Lady Gwenyth, then another."<br><br>The command hung, suspended, in the deafening silence that followed. From his low perspective, Stephen caught details with uncommon clarity: the ancient dust clinging to the hem of the king's cloak, the faint, septic smell of the ulcer on Henry's leg, the soft <em>chink </em>of the sovereign's chain of office as his massive chest rose and fell, and the dying echo of a plucked lute string.<br><br>All the court waited in a state of breath-held anticipation. The king had flung down the gauntlet, had challenged one of the few men in the realm who dared defy him.<br><br>Stephen de Lacey was no fool, and he valued his neck. The years, at least, had taught him to equivocate. "Your will be done, sire." He spoke clearly so all could hear, for he knew if he mumbled the pledge, the king would make him repeat it.<br><br>A collective sigh came from the Privy Councillors. How they loved seeing one of their own humiliated.<br><br>Henry lowered his vast bulk onto the throne. "I trust you'll obey this time."<br><br>Stephen stood. The king dismissed him with a curt nod. Almost immediately, Henry began to bellow for his attendants. "Saddle my horse, I wish to go riding."<br><br>Stephen left the Presence Chamber and passed through the antechamber. The air of corruption lingered even here, in the heavy scent of sandalwood burning in a corner brazier, in the stale mats of rushes that had not been changed in months.<br><br>Prior to his audience, Stephen had requested that his horse be brought out, for he wanted to be away swiftly. The grooms of the royal stables had promised to have the tall Neapolitan mare ready outside the west gate.<br><br>Stephen strode across the courtyard and passed between the octagonal-shaped twin towers. He paused beneath the ornate portcullis, the pointed wrought-iron bars aimed straight down at his head.<br><br>As promised, his mare stood ready in saddle and trappings, tethered to an iron loop in the shade of a spreading oak some distance beyond the gatehouse.<br><br>He frowned at the negligence of the grooms. Didn't they know better than to leave a valuable animal unattended? And where the devil was Kit, his squire?<br><br>Cocking his head, Stephen saw a movement beside the mare. A wraithlike shadow, secretive as an uncon-fessed sin.<br><br>A filthy gypsy woman was stealing his horse.<br><br>Juliana could not believe her luck. So desperately had she needed a horse for the fair in Runnymede tomorrow, she had been prepared to enter the very walls of the riverside palace and boldly steal an animal.<br><br>Instead, as she crouched in a stand of copper beeches and regarded the glistening walls and gilt turrets of Richmond Palace, a groom had emerged with one of the most magnificent beasts she had ever seen. The horse was fitted out with trappings of silver and Morocco leather that would, if traded, feed the gypsy tribe for a decade.<br><br>Pavlo, her windhound, had scared the lad off. By now it was a common ploy. No Englishman had ever seen a <em>borzoya, </em>and most thought the huge white dog some sort of mythical beast.<br><br></p><h2>The Great Escape: Nine Jews Who Fled Hitler and Changed the World</h2><p>Traces the early twentieth century journey of nine men from Budapest--including Edward Teller, Robert Capa, and Michael Curtiz--who fled fascism and anti-Semitism to seek sanctuary in America, where they made pivotal contributions to such causes as the development of the atomic bomb, the creation of the computer, and the evolution of modern photojournalism. 50,000 first printing.</p><p><b>Kati Marton</b>, an award-winning former NPR and ABC News correspondent, is the author of <i>Hidden Power: Presidential Marriages That Shaped Our History</i>, a <i>New York Times</i> bestseller, as well as <i>Wallenberg, The Polk Conspiracy, A Death in Jerusalem</i>, and a novel, <i>An American Woman</i>. Mother of a son and a daughter, she lives in New York with her husband, Richard Holbrooke.<p></p><p>Introduction<br></p><p><b>Magic in Their Pockets</b><br></p><p></p><p>On a muggy day in July of 1939, two young physicists got into a blue Dodge coup�, crossed the Triborough Bridge, and drove past the futuristic World's Fair pavilion, passing fruit stands, vineyards, and modest farmhouses along Route 25, much of which was still unpaved, looking for the world's most famous scientist, Albert Einstein, who was spending the summer on Long Island. Their trip, and a second shortly thereafter, would have historic consequences.</p><p></p><p>Inside the car, which was his, Eugene Wigner, wispy-voiced and as unprepossessing as a small-town pharmacist, listened patiently to the intense, curly-haired Leo Szilard. Wigner always let his friend, whom he called "The General," think he was in charge, but Wigner's piercing eyes, hidden behind steel-rimmed glasses, missed nothing. As they drove, they argued in their native tongue, Hungarian, about what they would say to the great man.</p><p></p><p>Deep in a typically heated conversation, the two Hungarians got lost. For two hours they drove around the South Shore; Einstein's retreat, however, was in Peconic, on the North. Finally, they found Peconic, but the roads and gray shingle houses all looked identical to the pudgy Szilard, sweaty in his gray wool suit. Agitated, he began to think that fate might be against their bold step. The cooler Wigner calmed him down. "Let's just ask somebody where Einstein lives," he suggested. "Everybody knows who Einstein is." Finally, a boy of about seven pointed his fishing rod toward a one-story house with a screened front porch.</p><p></p><p>The sixty-year-old Einstein welcomed his visitors, old friends from Berlin days, wearing a white undershirt and rolled-up trousers. He had spent the morning sailing. Szilard and Wigner now switched to German and went straight to the point; they were in no mood for small talk. Einstein was aware of recent experiments in Germany suggesting that if neutrons bombarded uranium a nuclear chain reaction could be created. But the second part of the Hungarians' message was news to Einstein: that a nuclear chain reaction could lead to incredibly powerful bombs -- atomic bombs! Shaking his famous white mane, Einstein said, "Daran habe ich gar nicht gedacht" -- I had not thought of that at all. But Einstein's former colleagues at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics in Berlin, Szilard warned, appeared to be closing in on the discovery. Until that moment, Einstein, the man whose theories had launched the revolution in physics, had not believed that atomic energy would be liberated "in my lifetime." Now he saw how his famous equation of 1905, E=mc2, might apply to the explosive release of energy from mass, using uranium bombs.</p><p></p><p>Though a pacifist, Einstein well understood the Nazi threat; like Szilard and Wigner, he had left Germany because of Adolf Hitler. So the father of relativity signed a letter, prepared primarily by Szilard, to the Belgian ambassador in Washington, warning the Belgian government that bombs of unimaginable power could be made out of uranium, whose primary source was the Belgian Congo. Then Einstein returned to his dinghy, and the two Hungarians drove back to the city.</p><p></p><p>Szilard worried that this would not be enough: should they not also alert President Franklin Delano Roosevelt? "We did not know our way around in America," Szilard later recalled. But he knew an investment banker named Alexander Sachs, a friend of the president who did know Washington. After Szilard talked to Sachs, the banker concurred: the president must be told.</p><p></p><p>So two weeks later, on Sunday, July 30, Szilard returned to Einstein's cottage. Wigner was in California, so Szilard -- who did not know how to drive -- turned to another Hungarian, who owned a 1935 Plymouth: a young physics professor at Columbia University named Edward Teller. (Teller would later joke that he entered history as Leo Szilard's chauffeur.) Together Szilard and his bushy-browed driver extracted a second letter from Einstein. It was probably the most important letter of the twentieth century.</p><p></p><p>"I believe," the greatest scientist of the century wrote to the most important political leader of the age, "it is my duty to bring to your attention...that it may become possible to set up a nuclear chain reaction in a large mass of uranium, by which vast amounts of power and large quantities of new radium-like elements would be generated. Now it appears almost certain that this could be achieved in the immediate future. This new phenomenon would also lead to the construction of bombs, and it is conceivable -- though much less certain -- that extremely powerful bombs of a new type may thus be constructed. A single bomb of this type, carried by boat and exploded in a port, might very well destroy the whole port together with some of the surrounding territory.</p><p></p><p>"The United States has only very poor ores of uranium in moderate quantities. There is some good ore in Canada and the former Czechoslovakia, while the most important source of uranium is Belgian Congo.</p><p></p><p>"In view of this situation you may think it desirable to have some permanent contact maintained between the Administration and the group of physicists working on chain reactions in America." (Emphasis added.)</p><p></p><p>Szilard believed that such a letter, signed by none other than Albert Einstein, would get immediate attention. But it did not. On September 1, 1939, when Hitler attacked Poland, Einstein's letter lay unread somewhere in FDR's in-box.</p><p></p><p>Einstein's letter was finally brought directly to FDR's attention by Sachs on October 11, and began the process that would lead to the creation of the Manhattan Project -- the top secret government effort to build the atom bomb. But Roosevelt had no idea that the letter was the work of three Hungarian refugees who were not yet American citizens.</p><p></p><p>It was altogether fitting that these products of Budapest's Golden Age would stimulate the most momentous scientific-military enterprise of the twentieth century, leading to the Manhattan Project, and, after that, Hiroshima. Szilard, Wigner, and Teller -- these men were just part of a group of Hungarians who, after fleeing fascist Budapest in the 1920s and 1930s, brought their distinctive outlook on life, science, and culture to the United States and Western Europe -- and played immensely important roles in shaping the mid-twentieth-century world. Forced into exile by the rising tide of fascism, they would alter the way we fight and prevent wars, help shape those most modern art forms, photography and the movies, and transform the music we listen to.</p><p></p><p>This is the tale of some of them -- specifically, four scientists, two photographers, two film directors, and a writer -- who, collectively, helped usher in the nuclear age and the age of the computer, who left us some of our most beloved movies and many of the most enduring images of the violent century they navigated. The currents of twentieth-century history, science, culture, and politics entered them as young men in Budapest, and as they crossed borders and oceans in search of safety, they carried with them only their genius and ideas -- truly they had magic in their pockets.</p><p></p><p>Who were these men, and where did they come from? Was it simply a coincidence that they were from such a strange little country, with a language incomprehensible to the rest of the world? Or was there something peculiar about that country and that city at that time that created, in so many different fields, so many unusual people?</p><p></p><p>Leo Szilard, Edward Teller, and Eugene Wigner -- along with another genius from Budapest, John von Neumann -- brought to America more than the physics revolution. Having saved themselves from Hitler, they were determined to alert their new nation to the mounting danger. Buffeted by every political upheaval of the century, the four scientists, and the others in this narrative, were in the vanguard of an early warning system. Working in vastly different fields, they tried to rouse a world still averting its gaze from the gathering storm. As the scientists pushed for the atom bomb, Arthur Koestler was writing Darkness at Noon, the first real expos� of Stalinist brutality to achieve worldwide fame. Michael Curtiz was making Casablanca, as much a call to anti-fascist arms as it is a romance. Robert Capa was making an immortal photographic record of the helpless victims of Generalissimo Francisco Franco's indiscriminate aerial bombs, photographs to stand alongside Pablo Picasso's Guernica in the field of art as political statement.</p><p></p><p>This is the chronicle of the remarkable journey of nine men from Budapest to the New World, how they strove and what they learned along the way, and the imprint they made on America and the world.</p><p></p><p>Some of the nine -- Robert Capa and Edward Teller -- are famous, others less so, but of equal consequence. John von Neumann, widely believed by his contemporaries to be the smartest of them all, pioneered the electronic computer and invented Game Theory. Andre Kertesz, along with Capa and Henri Cartier-Bresson, virtually invented modern photojournalism. The names of Michael Curtiz and Alexander Korda may be less well known today, but their work is immortal. Curtiz's Casablanca is the most popular romantic film of all time. Korda, whose life story is more fanciful than any Hollywood fabrication, also left enduring movies; in 1994 the New York Times called Korda's The Third Man "one of the finest films ever made," a widely held judgment. Arthur Koestler is on every list of the twentieth century's greatest political writers.</p><p></p><p>They had in common, first of all, a time and a place. They were members of the same generation, roughly spanning the last decade of the nineteenth century until the outbreak of World War I.

Nesser himself has a notably dry and ironic sense of humour, more redolent of this island than Sweden, and intermittently makes London his home. He also has something in common with another great generator of suspense, Leytonstone-born Alfred Hitchcock: a preoccupation with guilt and the way in which crime draws everyone connected with it into a dark moral miasma - as in the latest book to reach these shores, Hour of the Wolf . . . All this is dispatched with the assurance that readers have come to expect from the author of such quietly compelling crime fiction as The Return and Woman With Birthmark. As before with Nesser, we are reminded of the writer Ruth Rendell in the coolly methodical fashion in which lives are destroyed by a crime, those of both the victims and the perpetrators . . . there is not a single misstep as the grim implications of the narrative are teased out.

Both the technological sophistication of their weaponry and the skill of their gunners was largely the result of the adoption of the system devised by one man, Jean-Baptiste Vaquette de Gribeauval. Gribeauval&#39;s standardised system of parts and calibres allowed a degree of uniformity and sophistication in the French artillery that was unmatched throughout Europe, and allowed Napoleon to inherit and develop an arm that could dominate the battlefield. This volume covers the field artillery pieces of the system: the 4-, 8- and 12-pdr guns; light 1-pdr guns and mountain guns; and later innovations such as the 6-pdr gun.</p><p>The unrivalled illustrated reference on fighting vehicles, transport and artillery through the ages.

They had left Rio de Janeiro for the long trip back to France, nestled in crisp white sheets in a first-class cabin aboard the <i>Lutetia</i>, the black ocean outside the portal window. Time was a relative matter, as the ship made a vector for the equator. The year was 1929. The roaring twenties were about to end with the stock market crash, but no such realities would intervene in that stateroom. Propped up on one elbow, he could hardly believe his good fortune, meeting Josephine Baker in Buenos Aires several days before. In Rio they sipped caipirinha cocktails and sauntered along Impanema beach, and she was so lovely he painted portraits of her, using the colored pencils he had brought for work. On board, they attended an elaborate costume party. He dressed as an Indian soldier with a polka-dot bandana, and she was a China doll. &#x201c;Oh, Monsieur Le Corbusier, what a shame you&#x2019;re an architect!&#x201d; she had said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;d have made such a good partner!&#x201d;1<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled, knowing their worlds were not so far apart. As his stateroom companion well knew, he was no ordinary draftsman.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had been welcomed as a celebrity just as much as she was: the man from Paris, stepping out in tailored suit, pocket square and bow-tie, filling lecture halls across the continent with those eager to hear his radical new theories in architecture and urban planning. He was breaking the mold in building homes and entire cities, just as Picasso had in painting, and Hemingway with the novel&#x2014;sculpting smooth, white, streamlined buildings that had never been seen before, forgoing wood and brick and stone for concrete, replacing staircases with spirals and ramps, wrapping exteriors with long ribbons of black-framed windows, and planting gardens on rooftop terraces. Everything about his architecture was different. He perched his buildings on sturdy yet elegant concrete columns he called <i>pilotis</i>, freeing the ground for cars and open space, and making the structures appear to float in air. And his formula was repeatable&#x2014;efficient housing built with low-cost construction methods, whether three-story townhouses or towers set in parks, linked by spacious high-speed roadways and ultimately served by planes and helicopters. The turn of the 20th century had brought the machine age&#x2014;cars, locomotives, planes, and the factories of mass-production manufacturing&#x2014;and that most fundamental of life&#x2019;s functions, the habitation of homes and cities, required the same modernization. The dapper visitor with the slicked-back hair and round black eyeglasses was delivering a new way to live.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Becoming Le Corbusier&#x2014;not just a man, but a force&#x2014;had required no little marketing. He adopted the pseudonym in 1920, leaving behind his given name, Charles-�douard Jeanneret Gris. Taking a single moniker was popular among the bohemians and artists in Paris at the time, and for him the act had a symbolism all its own. While inspired in part by his great-grandfather, Monsieur Lecorbesier of Brussels, and the 18th-century French actress Adrienne Lecouvreur, former resident of the townhouse where he lived in Paris, the renaming signaled his break with the past, with Victorian and bourgeois traditions, and the embrace of the modern. But it was also an exercise in branding. The original star architect would be forever distinguished from all other innovators in design, including his American rival, Frank Lloyd Wright. The name was reminiscent of a mystic bird of Celtic lore, the highly intelligent hunter and scavenger, <i>le corbeau,</i> the raven. He had taken to drawing himself as the sleek black bird, peering down from a tightly gripped perch, assessing the landscape, ready to launch in acrobatic flight.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of Paris, wealthy clients and bohemians alike, knew where to go to find new ideas in design: 35 Rue de Sevres, the bustling atelier next door to the department store Le Bon Marche. The equivalent of a start-up in a garage, the top floor of an unremarkable building in the 6th arrondissement served as his headquarters, little more than a long corridor with drafting tables and adjustable black lamps, one after the other, rolled-up papers and plans hanging on the walls and sprouting from the floor in bunches, like some kind of crazy shrubbery. The apprentices reported in each morning, eager to work for the visionary master, alongside the team partners and like-minded innovators, his cousin, Pierre Jeanneret, and the furniture designer Charlotte Perriand. Each month, it seemed, brought a new building design, a new way to organize life: the places for living, for business, for government, for recreation, and culture.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atelier was the fountainhead for all manner of innovations&#x2014;a car that was precursor to the Volkswagen Beetle, furniture made of aluminum tubing and black leather and spotted horsehair, even, in time, a women&#x2019;s clothing line, an ensemble of V-neck blouse, pleated skirt and go anywhere sandals, submitted to America&#x2019;s first fashion magazine, Harper&#x2019;s Bazaar. At night the team would celebrate with wine and champagne in the bistros of the Latin Quarter, and in the morning, after the master had done calisthenics or played basketball and painted, his lifelong side pursuit, they would all re-assemble and get back to the blueprints and do it all over again.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was gratifying, and utterly intentional, that the people of Latin America, a hemisphere away, would hear about all the excitement. The trip there was one of many international forays for the ambassador of the new order. The fast-growing cities of Argentina and Brazil needed his help, to be better-organized, cleaner, more orderly places. Le Corbusier was the man with the plan. In standing-room only lecture halls, he sketched the next city with charcoal on tan newsprint, never reading from prepared remarks, but instead creating a storyboard on the spot. He drew chains of apartment buildings set in open space, awash in sunlight and fresh air, recreation and circulation all around, proposing it all as the most natural of evolutions. To demonstrate how cities cannot be frozen in time, he drew the cathedral of Notre Dame and the Eiffel Tower, and then his towers in the park; the progression honored the past, but didn&#x2019;t stay stuck in it, not least because cities of the future needed to be prepared for ever-increasing populations. But as he also wrote, the critics and the mandarins in academia were saying no to all of it. They thought it outrageous, to move on from convention and propose new forms. And that just made Le Corbusier more exciting, a true rebel. The Argentinians and Brazilians felt like they were part of something&#x2014;that they were being given the keys to the future. They could even leap-frog places like Paris and even New York, in embracing the modern.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In one rendering from the perspective of being out at sea and looking onshore, he painted a set of three proposed apartment buildings in Rio, rendered in a soft yellow in a purplish haze, as if glowing with the promise of a happy future. It was a thrilling prospect, and Le Corbusier relished the role of messiah. the prophet of the new architecture, blared the headline of an advertisement for a Spanish translation of the book he published in Europe years earlier, <i>Towards an Architecture,</i> touted in the copy as &#x201c;the bible of the perfect dwelling.&#x201d;2<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fellow diners whispered to each other about the famous architect visiting from Paris, in the august interior of the Jockey Club in Buenos Aires. On the streets he was stopped for autographs. In a bar one night, a group bought him so many beers he lost count, saluting and toasting him and all but not letting him leave. By day he scheduled appearances at universities and meetings with government officials and lunches with the wealthy elite, such as Victoria Ocampo, editor of the literary journal <i>Sur,</i> which featured such writers as Jorge Luis Borges. Corbusier viewed Ocampo as possessing singular good taste and strength; she returned the favor by helping him with the logistics of his lecture appearances.3 While the urban planning schemes had broad appeal, the rich and powerful had something more selfish in mind. They wanted him to build a modern architecture masterpiece for villas of their own.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It didn&#x2019;t take much time for Josephine Baker to have that idea as well. From the time the fellow Parisian introduced himself after her performance in Buenos Aires, it was clear this was not just another fan eager to meet her backstage. She was charmed and curious. Within a few days of their paths crossing, she was asking him to design a house for her on the Right Bank in Paris, close to Montmarte and the nightclub that helped make her famous, the Maude de Forest.</p><h2>The Everlasting Man</h2><p>Chesterton&#39;s concise classic history of humanity and Christ -- complete with appendices.</p><p>What, if anything, is it that makes the human uniquely human? This, in part, is the question that G.K. Chesterton starts with in this classic exploration of human history. Responding to the evolutionary materialism of his contemporary (and antagonist) H.G. Wells, Chesterton in this work affirms human uniqueness and the unique message of the Christian faith. Writing in a time when social Darwinism was rampant, Chesterton instead argued that the idea that society has been steadily progressing from a state of primitivism and barbarity towards civilization is simply and flatly inaccurate. "Barbarism and civilization were not successive stages in the progress of the world," he affirms, with arguments drawn from the histories of both Egypt and Babylon. <p> As always with Chesterton, there is in this analysis something (as he said of Blake) "very plain and emphatic." He sees in Christianity a rare blending of philosophy and mythology, or reason and story, which satisfies both the mind and the heart. On both levels it rings true. As he puts it, "in answer to the historical query of why it was accepted, and is accepted, I answer for millions of others in my reply; because it fits the lock; because it is like life." Here, as so often in Chesterton, we sense a lived, awakened faith. All that he writes derives from a keen intellect guided by the heart's own knowledge. <i>--Doug Thorpe</i></p>Gilbert Keith Chesterton (1874-1936) was an English writer whose prolific and diverse output included philosophy, ontology, poetry, plays, journalism, public lectures and debates, literary and art criticism, biography, Christian apologetics, and fiction, including fantasy and detective fiction.</p><h2>Want Not</h2><p>A <i>New York Times</i> Notable Book<br><br>&#x201c;A wonderful book, and there&#x2019;s no one I would not urge to read it . . .

At least that&#x2019;s what the lifeguard told the paramedics and the paramedics told the doctors and the doctors told my mother. I don&#x2019;t deny I swam to the bottom of the public swimming pool. I don&#x2019;t even deny I decided to stay there. I only defend my motives. My decision was much less about escaping this world and much more about joining another.<br><br>I think that should count for something.<br><br>When I regained consciousness, I opened my eyes to a pair of blurry faces. My mother with her perpetually pinched eyebrows, raking her teeth over swollen lips. And Grandpa Dan&#x2014;with my father&#x2019;s face, but twenty years older. His callused grip pressed through the shoulder of my hospital gown, anchoring my body to a reality I didn&#x2019;t want to face, awakening my senses until I noticed stiff sheets rubbing against my toes, beeping monitors, the smell of antiseptic, and a man I didn&#x2019;t recognize. <br><br>He studied me over a pair of bifocals and clicked his pen against a clipboard, jotting mysterious notes whenever I talked or sighed or breathed funny. His name was Dr. Nowels, and he had a mustache the exact same shade as the dead mouse I found behind our trailer home the previous Easter.<br><br>After I was released from the hospital, my mom insisted I sit with him for an hour every Tuesday after school. I tried to convince her that I didn&#x2019;t need to see a shrink. That she was wasting her money. Or actually, Uncle Phil&#x2019;s money. But I sort of lost all credibility after the swimming pool fiasco.<br><br>At the start of each session, Dr. Nowels would lean back in his chair, cross one lanky leg over the other, and tap his pen against the bottom of his chin. &#x201c;How do you feel today, Bethany?&#x201d;<br><br>I would search for something creative to say. Something that might make his pen scratch in a frenzy across his paper. But nothing ever came. So instead, I stared at the same spot I always stared at. His hair. Not for a single minute did I believe it was real. Throughout the entire sixty minutes, while he asked questions, I pictured walking over, grabbing a fistful, and giving it a yank. I was dying to see what Dr. Nowels looked like bald.<br><br>Every time I told my mom this she&#x2019;d bite her lip and ask me not to use that word&#x2014;dying. Ten minutes before our time was up, Dr. Nowels would ask the same question he always asked. &#x201c;Are you ready to talk about why you did it, Bethany?&#x201d; It drove me nuts, the way he finished all his questions with my name.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know why, Dr. Nowels,&#x201d; I&#x2019;d say, trying my best to imitate the annoying cadence of his voice. Sometimes he would look at me as if I&#x2019;d said something profound and start scribbling while I narrowed my eyes one last time at his hairline. If it really was his hairline. <br><br>And so our sessions went. For an entire year.<br><br>Never once did I get to see Dr. Nowels without his toupee. Never once did he share what he wrote about me during all those hours. And never once did I explain why I did it.<br>One<br><br>Maybe it was the angle or the proximity, but Bethany Quinn had never felt so tempted to give Jeff McKinley&#x2019;s hairpiece<br>a good nudge. At the very least, an innocuous brush with her elbow. It didn&#x2019;t help that he was waving a powdered doughnut over the sketches she had worked on for the past week, leaving a sugary dust behind. She gripped the back of his chair and looked over his shoulder. &#x201c;What don&#x2019;t you like about them?&#x201d;<br><br>He gestured with the doughnut, sliding his free fingers across her drawing of the floating ceiling tray. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a little elaborate.&#x201d;<br><br>She let go of his chair and straightened. &#x201c;So?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I was under the impression this particular client was looking for something more...practical.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They never said practical. They said cheap.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Same thing.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not a warehouse, Jeff. We&#x2019;re renovating one of downtown Chicago&#x2019;s most popular ballrooms. Fancy doesn&#x2019;t have to be expensive.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;If you want it to look good, it does.&#x201d; He set down the rest of the doughnut and folded his hands behind his neck. His hairline shifted higher up his forehead. &#x201c;How much time before we meet with them?&#x201d;<br><br>Bethany&#x2019;s back pocket buzzed. &#x201c;We scheduled the meeting for three,&#x201d; she said, pulling out her cell phone. Her mother&#x2019;s number lit up the screen.<br><br>She furrowed her brow. Why in the world would her mother be calling at ten o&#x2019;clock on a Monday? Mom knew better than to bother her at work. Bethany sent the call to voice mail, her mind rabbit-trailing to her brother, David.<br><br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s see what else we can come up with before then. It&#x2019;d be best to give them several options to choose from, don&#x2019;t you think?&#x201d;<br><br>Jeff&#x2019;s words floated in her ear, but thoughts of her brother bounced around inside her head and made it impossible to concentrate. David left for Afghanistan three weeks ago. And now her mother was calling.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re in no position to lose clients right now. With all this talk about downsizing, that wouldn&#x2019;t bode well for any of us.&#x201d;<br><br>Bethany nodded.<br><br>&#x201c;Hey, you okay?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah. I just... I have to take this call.&#x201d; Her knees wobbled as she grabbed the sketches and made the short trek to her work station. She set them on her desk and spotted the flashing red blinker of her office phone. When the caller ID showed her mother&#x2019;s number, Bethany shut her eyes and sent a hopeful thought into the cosmos.<br><br>Please don&#x2019;t let this be about David...<br><br>She didn&#x2019;t believe in a loving God who listened to prayer, but sometimes she caught herself bargaining with the Universe&#x2014;sort of like a bribe, only she didn&#x2019;t have anything to offer. She dialed voice mail and waited until Mom&#x2019;s worried voice filled her ear. &#x201c;Bethany, it&#x2019;s your mother. Call me, please.&#x201d;<br><br>She pulled the phone away from her ear and glared at the receiver. That was it? No details? No hint of why she called? No Hey, Bethany, don&#x2019;t worry; this isn&#x2019;t about your brother?<br><br>The ambiguity of the message tightened the muscles in Bethany&#x2019;s shoulders. Her mother&#x2019;s brevity left her with no other option but to call back. She picked up the office phone, dialed Mom&#x2019;s number, and fiddled with the lid on her half-empty Starbucks macchiato. The cup tipped, spilling lukewarm liquid over the mahogany desktop and soaking her sketches. Sucking in a sharp breath, she righted the cup and swiped up her work. She tore a clump of tissues from the box near her computer and dabbed at the sheets. It was no use. The spilled coffee had turned the pristine white<br>pages into a mottled stack of brown sogginess.<br><br>&#x201c;Bethany? Is that you?&#x201d;<br><br>Bethany grabbed the phone with both hands. &#x201c;Mom? Why&#x2019;d you call? Is it David?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Are you at work?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Where else would I be?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s just that it&#x2019;s Monday, and I didn&#x2019;t think&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Mom, tell me what&#x2019;s wrong. Is it David?&#x201d;<br><br>A brief pause. &#x201c;Oh no. Your brother&#x2019;s fine.&#x201d;<br><br>Bethany&#x2019;s tension deflated. She sank onto her chair and pinched the bridge of her nose. She hated this. Worrying about her brother. Freaking out every time her phone rang. How was she supposed to cope with it for an entire year?<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not David. It&#x2019;s Robin.&#x201d;<br><br>Pieces of memory stirred at the sound of that name, rousing from a ten year hibernation. Why in the world was Mom calling her at work about Robin?<br><br>&#x201c;Did you hear what I said?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I heard you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you want to know what&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d;<br><br>The question poked her stomach. Say yes, and spend the next thirty minutes listening to Mom&#x2019;s hysterics. Say no, and sound like a royal jerk. She didn&#x2019;t have time for the first or energy for the second, so she picked up a pen and toyed with the bloated puddle creeping toward her pencil cup, the shortlived relief over David melting into a dull ache in the center of her forehead.<br><br>Silence stretched along the phone lines.<br><br>She gazed at the blueprints on her drafting board. Her boss needed specs for the River Oaks project on his desk by four o&#x2019;clock, fake-haired Jeff McKinley wanted to brainstorm &#x201c;practical&#x201d; ideas for the downtown ballroom, and Mom wouldn&#x2019;t give up until Bethany let her spill whatever news she had about Robin.<br><br>&#x201c;She was your best friend.&#x201d;<br><br>Was. Past tense.<br><br>&#x201c;Every time I see her, she asks about you. If you like Chicago. How your job is going. If you&#x2019;re happy...&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course I&#x2019;m happy.&#x201d; The words came out too fast. Almost defensive. Bethany rubbed circles on her throbbing temples and let a drawn-out sigh escort the inescapable question. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the matter with Robin?&#x201d;<br><br>A throat cleared loudly behind her. She swiveled around and found her boss, his mouth curved in a frown. She hung up the phone and stood, heat creeping into her ears. Mom&#x2019;s news would have to wait. &#x201c;Is everything okay?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Brainstorming session for First State at ten. Did you forget?&#x201d;<br><br>Her stomach twisted. Mom&#x2019;s cryptic phone call had jarred her out of focus. &#x201c;No, of course not. I was just on the phone with...&#x201d; She fingered the blueprints on her drafting board. &#x201c;Marketing about River Oaks.&#x201d; Martin grunted, eying the mess on her desk.<br><br>An uncomfortable laugh bubbled past Bethany&#x2019;s lips. She stepped in front of him and fished a file from one of her desk drawers. &#x201c;I drew up some ideas last week,&#x201d; she said, motioning toward the hallway. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m right behind you.&#x201d;<br><br>When she stepped into the conference room, she smoothed the front of her skirt and pushed the phone call from her conscience. Whatever problems Robin faced, she&#x2019;d have to face them alone. Bethany didn&#x2019;t see how she could help. Robin&#x2019;s troubles didn&#x2019;t concern her. Not anymore.<br><br>Her hands shook as she unwrapped a stick of Bubblemint gum and shoved it in her mouth. She crumpled the wrapper and leaned against the hood of her Audi, ruminating over her mother&#x2019;s second phone call. For once Mom hadn&#x2019;t been exaggerating. Bethany exhaled and watched her frozen breath escape like mist into the night sky.<br><br>Cold pricked her ears as she tapped her foot against the blacktop of the Walgreens parking lot and traced the outline of the sympathy card tucked inside the small paper bag. &#x201c;Thinking of You&#x201d; emblazoned the cover in a large, looping font. Stark white painted the inside. A symbol of what her friendship with Robin had become. What had she been thinking, buying it? What could she possibly write that might take up so much space when there was nothing to say?<br><br>She pulled her keys from her purse and climbed into her car. Maybe she would go to Dominic&#x2019;s, and when he came home from work, she could unleash her guilt. Maybe she could purge the thoughts rolling through her head and regain some equilibrium. She started the engine, pulled onto the street, and forced herself to focus on the news analyst discussing the struggling economy on her XM radio.<br><br>Thirty minutes later, Bethany walked in the door of Dominic&#x2019;s apartment to lights and the aroma of Chinese takeout. After slipping off her heels, she found him hunched over the dining table in pajama pants and glasses, surrounded by a pile of papers, a half-eaten carton of General Tso&#x2019;s next to one arm and a box of tissue next to the other.<br><br>She set her purse on the table by the door. &#x201c;Are you sick?&#x201d;<br><br>He started to answer but coughed instead. When the fit released him, he plucked a tissue from the box and blew his nose. &#x201c;No, but Patrick sent me home anyway.&#x201d; Dominic peered at her across the living room. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re done with work already?&#x201d;<br><br>She glanced at the wall clock. It was half past seven. &#x201c;I had a productive day.&#x201d; This, of course, was a lie. But how would Dominic understand her obliterated concentration when she couldn&#x2019;t explain it to herself?<br><br>She shuffled to the dining room, eased into one of the chairs, and reached for the white carton while he slid a thick manila folder from his briefcase and added it to the overflowing pile on the table.<br><br>&#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t eat that.&#x201d; He stifled two sharp coughs in the crook of his elbow and, without looking up from his papers, jerked his head toward the refrigerator. &#x201c;I got you lo mein. Chopsticks are on the counter.&#x201d;<br><br>Her stomach rumbled in gratitude. She heated her dinner in the microwave, returned to the dining room, and started eating while Dominic shuffled through the stack of papers in front of him. Around the fifth or sixth bite, Bethany dropped her chopsticks and opened the fortune cookie.<br><br>Something you lost will soon turn up.<br><br>She rolled up the white slip and huffed.<br><br>Dominic ignored her.<br><br>&#x201c;What are you working on?&#x201d; she asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Contracts.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What kind of contracts?&#x201d; She picked several cookie crumbs off the place mat and folded them in her napkin. When he didn&#x2019;t answer, she fidgeted in her seat. &#x201c;Dom?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; The single syllable snapped across the table.<br><br>Bethany raised her eyebrows and pressed her lips together.<br><br>He took off his glasses and ran his hand down the stubble on his chin.<br><br>&#x201c;C&#x2019;mon, Bethany, I&#x2019;m up to my ears.&#x201d;<br><br>So much for unburdening her soul.<br><br>She snatched up his carton and pushed away from the table, the legs of her chair scraping against the hardwood floor.<br><br>Dominic groaned.<br><br>She stalked to the kitchen and dumped all the leftovers. Maybe she should go home. Sleep in her own bed for once and reconsider the long talk she and Dominic had over Thanksgiving&#x2014;about moving in together once her lease expired at the end of the year. Why would she move in with him when he treated her like nothing more than a nuisance?<br><br>She closed the trash compactor and rinsed off a plate in the sink. If only memories could be as easily erased. If only a little water could wash them down the drain. If only she could send the stupid card and let this Robin thing go. She reached for a towel just as a pair of strong arms wrapped around her waist.<br><br>She stiffened.<br><br>He let go. &#x201c;C&#x2019;mon, Bethy, don&#x2019;t be mad.&#x201d;<br><br>The way he said her name loosened some of the tightness in her chest. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m swamped at work, and I feel horrible. I hate being sick.&#x201d;<br><br>She rolled her eyes. &#x201c;I thought you weren&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to be.&#x201d; He took the plate from her and put it in the dishwasher.<br><br>&#x201c;You know how it is.&#x201d;<br><br>She bunched the towel in her hand. Maybe now, with his work in another room, he would listen. &#x201c;You know Robin Price?&#x201d;<br><br>His forehead knotted.<br><br>&#x201c;Robin from Peaks? She sends Christmas cards every year? Birthday and Easter cards too?&#x201d; Something uncomfortable fidgeted inside her. Why hadn&#x2019;t she ever responded? Sure, things had changed&#x2014;Robin had changed&#x2014;but was it really that hard to send a card?<br><br>&#x201c;You know I&#x2019;m no good at keeping track of that stuff.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She was my best friend growing up. We were practically inseparable.&#x201d;<br><br>He grabbed a tissue from the box on the counter and blew his nose.<br><br>&#x201c;I guess her husband had some sort of aneurism and now he&#x2019;s in a<br><br>coma.&#x201d; She waited for a response, but the glassed-over look in his eyes told her she waited in vain. She crossed her arms and raised her eyebrows at him. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t remember you talking about her.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We haven&#x2019;t been close for a long time.&#x201d;<br><br>He grabbed a wineglass from the counter and nudged her away from the sink. &#x201c;So why are you so upset?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d; She picked at the corner of the marbled countertop. &#x201c;I sort of feel like I should go see her...</p><h2>Yeats Selected Poetry</h2><p>William Butler Yeats (1865-1939) is one of the greatest English language poets, a status confirmed by the award of the 1923 Nobel Prize for Literature. At various times revolutionary patriot, upholder of an idealised aristocratic tradition, and Senator of the Irish Free State, Yeats was also a student of the occult and other arcana. An often obsessive lover, his poetry draws upon a rich vein of mystic melancholy and<br>Irish mythology, and wide, eclectic reading in literature, history and philosophy. Standing at the crossroads between the exuberant romanticism of Blake and helley, and the dark realism of such modern masters as Ted Hughes, Philip Larkin and Seamus Heaney, Yeats's poetry chronicles the ceaseless, dedicated quest of a genius for the meanings of personal and public life, of historical change and of the hereafter.<br>With a thoughtful and illuminating essay by Professor A. Norman Jeff ares, setting Yeats's work within a poetic, cultural and historic perspective, this selection is an indispensable introduction to a writer whose true and abiding significance is only now beginning to be fully understood.<br>Edited with revised and updated ntroduction and notes by A. Norman Jeffares<br></p><p>W B Yeats (1865 - 1939) is one of the great and innovative poets of the twentieth century. Much of his most vigorous verse on love, sex, Irish and international politics, the complexities of the occult and the &#39;sedentary toil&#39; of poetry was producedin the years between his fiftieth birthday in 1915 and his death in 1939.</p><h2>Grimscribe: his lives and works</h2><p>Seeking deadly justice when she and her invalid father receive next to nothing in a lawsuit settlement, nurse Hester Jones targets the defense attorney&#39;s daughter, hematologist Liz Broward. By the author of Blood Work. Original.</p><p>Grimscribe: His Lives and Works is the second volume in a series of revised, definitive editions of the horror story collections of Thomas Ligotti. First published in 1991 by Carroll &amp; Graf in the United States and Robinson Publishing in England, Grimscribe garnered significantly more recognition than Ligotti's first collection, Songs of a Dead Dreamer, which was issued two years earlier by the same publishers.In the view of many commentators, it was with Grimscribe that Ligotti consolidated his reputation as a horror writer of high stature. As Steven J. Mariconda remarked in a 1992 essay surveying the stories in Songs of a Dead Dreamer and Grimscribe: &#x201c;Of the two collections, Grimscribe achieves near-classic status and is recommended to all.&#x201d; Included in this volume is &#x201c;The Last Feast of Harlequin,&#x201d; a novella that, in the observation of H. P. Lovecraft scholar and biographer S. T. Joshi, &#x201c;may perhaps be the very best homage to Lovecraft ever written.&#x201d; Like the stories in Songs of a Dead Dreamer, the first title of Ligotti's to be published in a revised, definitive edition by Subterranean Press, those presented here in Grimscribe: His Lives and Works have been amended to realize the full artistic aims of the originals rather than to compose new versions of these works. This volume may thus be considered, in the manner of its predecessor in this series, as both as a reissue and the culminating specimen of its master effort of twenty years ago.High-style horror stories in a classic literary mode, in expressiveness not far from the American masters, Poe and H.P. Lovecraft. Ligotti (Songs of a Dead Dreamer, 1990) writes out of what seems an all-embracing depression, making him willing to go into wipeout areas time and again and ask a lot both of himself and his readers. His narrators seldom effect any change; they simply observe a superbly described inner state, then leave, hungover. In ``The Last Feast of Harlequin,'' a professor obsessed with clowns locates a clown festival in the midwestern town of Mirocaw. He goes to observe and join the townsfolk in their festival, perhaps wearing his clown suit. But the festival is not meant for him. In fact, it is two festivals, one within the other, the inner one being a cruel festival of freaks who are detested and beaten by members of the larger clown festival. He joins the freaks and follows them out of town and down a hole in the earth wherein they have borne their frigid Winter Queen. In a cavernous earthen hall, the freaks begin turning into huge worms, and he flees up the black wormhole by which he entered. In ``The Glamour,'' the narrator enters a weird boarded-up movie house to find himself in a sparse audience surrounded by purple lights and seated amid hairy threads that bind all to their seats as they watch a cobweb screen on which is shown grisly purple organs being operated on. He leaves before he can be imprisoned by the floating and crawling hairs. In ``The Night School,'' he enters a dark, weird schoolground where strange figures stand around misshapen metal drums in firelight; then he goes into the hideously rotting school for a bizarre class in ``measurement of cloacal forces. Time as a flow of sewage. The excrement of space, scatology of creation...'' He leaves, finding the moon ``coated with a luminous mold, floating...in the great sewers of the night.''

It requires a step-by-step methodology for going from a blank page to a complete process diagram. It also requires consistent application of a modeling style, so that the modeler's meaning is clear from the diagram itself. Author Bruce Silver explains not only the meaning and proper usage of the entire BPMN 2.0 palette, but calls out the working subset that you really need to know. He also reveals the hidden assumptions of core concepts left unexplained in the spec, the key to BPMN's deeper meaning. <p> The book addresses BPMN at three levels, with primary focus on the first two. Level 1, or descriptive BPMN, uses a basic working set of shapes and symbols to meet the needs of business users doing process mapping. Level 2, or analytical BPMN, is aimed at business analysts and architects. It takes advantage of BPMN's expressiveness for detailing event and exception handling, key to analyzing and improving process performance and quality. Level 3, or executable BPMN, is brand new in BPMN 2.0. Here the XML underneath the diagram shapes becomes an executable design can be deployed to a process engine to automate the process. The method and style detailed in the book aligns these three levels, facilitating business-IT collaboration throughout the process lifecycle. </p><p> Inside the book you'll find discussions, illustrated with over 100 examples, about: </p><p> The questions BPMN asks, and does not ask The meaning of basic concepts like starting and completing, sending and receiving, waiting and listening Subprocesses and hierarchical modeling style The five basic steps in creating Level 1 models Event and exception-handling patterns Branching and merging patterns Level 2 modeling method Elements of BPMN style: element usage and diagram composition</p></p><p>An excellent basic framework, showing which features are useful at each layer of refinement. This book could have been aptly named <i>BPMN Bible for Business Analysts</i>.Business Process Modeling Notation is famous for combining business-friendliness with the expressiveness and semantic precision demanded by IT. Despite its acceptance as the standard for business process modeling, few in either business or IT know how to use it effectively. The ability to create process models that can stand on their own, understandable from the diagram alone without an accompanying explanation, requires more than a dictionalry of BPMN's shapes and symbols. It also requires a step-by-step methodology and a manual of BPMN style. BPMN Method and Style delivers just that. <p>Loaded with diagrams and examples, the book provides elements of style in combination with a cookbook method for process modeling at multiple levels. </p><p>* Level 1, or descriptive BPMN, uses a basic working set of diagram elements to meet the needs of business users looking to map current processes and improve them. <br>* Level 2, or analytical BPMN, leverages the full BPMN palette to create models that clearly express fine details, including event and exception handling. BPMN Level 2 is the long-sought "common process language" shared by business and IT. <br>* Level 3, or executable BPMN, is brand new in BPMN 2.0. It extends the XML underneath the diagram to a complete executable design language. </p><p>BPMN Method and Style aligns these levels so that each is a refinement of the previous. The result is a single process model, viewable at different levels of detail, shareable across the company.</p></p><h2>Green Woodworking: A Hands-On-Approach</h2><p>Learn or improve upon basic green woodworking skills with this revised, updated edition.

These reviewers formulated a brilliant response to the attack on Pius, but their work was scattered in various newspapers, magazines, and scholarly journals&#x2015;making it nearly impossible for the average reader to gauge the results. In <i>The Pius War</i>, <i>Weekly Standard</i>'s Joseph Bottum has joined with Rabbi David G. Dalin to gather a representative and powerful sample of these reviews, deliberately chosen from a wide range of publications. Together with a team of professors, historians, and other experts, the reviewers conclusively investigate the claims attacking Pius XII. <i>The Pius War</i>, and a detailed annotated bibliography that follows, will prove to be a definitive tool for scholars and students&#x2015;destined to become a major resource for anyone interested in questions of Catholicism, the Holocaust, and World War II.</p><p><b>Joseph Bottum</b> is Books &amp; Arts editor of <i>The Weekly Standard</i>. <b>David G.

(Rabbi Daniel Lapin, President, Toward Tradition)<br><br>The contributors to this important volume have made judicious arguments in defense of the actions of Pope Pius XII before, during, and after the Holocaust. These arguments deserve an equally judicious hearing from non-Catholics &#x2015; especially from Jews &#x2015; who need to know how they are to judge this pope when they remember an unforgettable event in their own history and in the history of the West.

(<i>Literary Review, (U.K.)</i>)<br><br>Henceforth, any scholar interested in writing the definitive biography of Pope Pius XII must deal with this work. (<i>New Oxford Review</i>)<br><br>This collection is to be strongly recommended both to specialists in the field and a lay audience. (<i>The Catholic Historical Review</i>)<br><br>During the Second World War, the <i>New York Times</i> praised Pope Pius XII as 'a lonely voice crying out of the silence of a continent.' After the war, Grand Rabbi Isaac Herzog of Jerusalem sent the Pope a special blessing for 'his life-saving efforts on behalf of the Jews.' Upon the death of Pius XII, Golda Meir observed that 'during the years of Nazi terror, when the Jewish people went through the horrors of martyrdom, the Pope raised his voice to condemn the persecutors and to commiserate with the victims.' Yet, since the publication of socialist writer Rolf Hochhuth's play <i>Der Stellvertreter</i> in 1963, the Pope's reputation has suffered. Many people believe that he was "silent" in the face of German atrocities, and some even go so far as to suggest that he harbored sympathy for the Nazis. Had the editors of the <i>New York Times</i>, Grand Rabbi Herzog, and Prime Minister Meir all been duped? The authors of <i>The Pius War</i> make the case that the praise Pius received during and after the war was, in fact, well deserved. Far from being "Hitler's Pope," as his most extreme critics have labeled him, Pius XII did what he could, in extraordinarily difficult circumstances, to aid the victims of Nazi terror&#x2015;Jews and Christians alike. Who is right? Fair-minded people will want to read authors on both sides of the debate before settling their minds. Those who have read the well-publicized works of Pius's critics will find much to ponder in this collection of patient and thoughtful writings in his defense. (Robert P.

This book is his magnum opus, a comprehensive and definitive history of Australian art. Lavishly illustrated and meticulously researched, <i>Australian Art: A History</i> provides an overview of the major developments in Australian art, from its origins to the present. The book commences with ancient Aboriginal rock art and early colonialists' interpretations of their surroundings, and moves on to discuss the formation of an Australian identity through art, the shock of early modernism and the notorious Heide circle. It finishes with the popular recognition of modern Indigenous art and contemporary Australian art and its place in the world. A major emphasis is placed on the art of the past fifty years, when both Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australian art have received widespread international acclaim. All major expressions of visual culture in Australia are addressed, including painting, sculpture, graphic arts, photography, applied arts, installation art and digital art.</p><p><b>Emeritus Professor Sasha Grishin AM</b>, FAHA established the academic discipline of Art History at the Australian National University and until December 2013 was the Sir William Dobell Professor of Art History and Head of Art History at the ANU in Canberra.

He grew up in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and India. He studied at the universities of Delhi and Oxford and published the first of eight novels, The Circle of Reason in 1986. He currently divides his time between Calcutta, Goa and Brooklyn. The first novel in the Ibis trilogy, Sea of Poppies, was shortlisted for the Man Booker prize.By an ingenious hotchpotch of different languages and registers, Ghosh&#39;s story roars along, constantly flipping between high seriousness and low humour. It is simultaneously wrong-footing and delightful * Guardian * A rollicking wordfest that sprawls across land, sea, social class and ethnicities, sweeping us along in its narrative drive * Guardian * This doorstopper of a novel, thick as curry with Anglo-Indian patois and with a bundle of rattlingly good narratives, makes one desperate that he does continue * The Times, Books of the Year * Exuberant * Guardian * Sweeps Amitav Ghosh majestically to the pinnacle of historical fiction writers * Oxford Times * A rip roaring story rich with history, an erudite critique of colonialism, funny and full of contemporary parallels * Independent * Ghosh&#39;s ebullient fluency in the colorful argot of the contentious worlds he brings forth distinguishes this passionately researched series as much as his wily and zealous exposure of entrenched discrimination pertaining to race, religion, gender, caste, and class. Once again Ghosh proves himself to be a virtuoso scene-setter and action writer . . . This feverishly detailed, vividly panoramic, tumultuous, funny, and heartbreaking tale offers a vigorous conclusion to Ghosh&#39;s astutely complex and profoundly resonant geopolitical saga * Booklist * Unexpectedly comic * Sunday Times * Flood of Fire sweeps Amitav Ghosh majestically to the pinnacle of historical fiction writers and fittingly completes his Ibis trilogy . . . Ghosh has long set a standard for the kind of fine historical fiction writing that paints perfect pictures of what life was like for ordinary people as the world changed around them at breakneck pace. What sets him apart from other writers in this genre is his knowledge of the subject and his detailed descriptions and minute detail * Dundee Courier * If you fancy a rip-roaring story with history, an erudite critique of colonialism, funny and full of contemporary parallels, you could try Amitav Ghosh&#39;s third in his Ibis trilogy, Flood of Fire * i * A terrific read. I wish Amitav Ghosh could live forever, like Ganesh, the Hindu patron god of writers and complete what he once planned. Flood of Fire, alas, will have to do * The Times * Graphic and gripping * New Statesman * Amply justifying the hype and expectation, this is a thrillingly realised and richly populated novel, imbued with a wealth of historical detail, suffused with the magic of place and plotted with great verve: Flood of Fire is a beautiful novel in its own right, and a compelling conclusion to an epic and sweeping story, one of the greatest literary works of our time. For Amitav Ghosh, the glittering literary prizes beckon * Nudge Book * The star of the proceedings is the historical detail that really brings it all alive. Anyone who knows me knows my love of historical factoids and Amitav provides enough for us to luxuriate in them. The difference between the treatment of British and Indian soldiers, the colonial structure, the importance of China and the opium fields, not to mention the rituals surrounding taking opium - it&#39;s all here with much more besides, simultaneously entertaining and educating. I will definitely be going back to the beginning of the trilogy and look forward to catching up * Bookbag * A huge, sprawling, rumbustious novel . . . rich and engrossing . . . a splendid adventure story, full of rich and varied characters and romantic entanglements . . . In the last chapters Amitav Ghosh pulls the strings of his enthralling trilogy together. It&#39;s a remarkable achievement: an adventure novel full of feeling, but one which also invites - even compels - you to think about the assumptions which men act upon * Scotsman * The best bits of the trilogy, however, do not merely satirize the greed and hypocrisy of the foreign traders; but allow crosscurrents of sympathy . . . full of unforgettable vignettes * The Spectator * Ghosh&#39;s scrupulous depiction of army life is just one part of this tour de force of historical description. Together, the novels are a weighty and precious chronicle of those times, a compendium of lost habits, languages and attitudes . . . Flood of Fire has all the romance, subterfuge and ingenious plotting to keep Ghosh&#39;s audience firmly lagowed. But it is the integrity of his historical vision that will ensure his books outlast other literary dumbpokes * FT Weekend * The final instalment of an extraordinary trilogy . . . Ghosh&#39;s story roars along, constantly flipping between high seriousness and low humour. It is simultaneously wrong-footing and delightful, riveting and diverting . . . His expansive trilogy has, in fact, advanced his story by only a few years; but the ground it has covered is almost immeasurable * Guardian * It is a testimony to Ghosh&#39;s great skills that he can both teach us history and create believable fictional characters . . . What makes Ghosh&#39;s characters come alive all the more is the use of language . . . Ghosh, occasionally, translates, but often does not, yet pulls off this presentation of the medley of tongues his characters use with great aplomb -- Mihir Bose * Independent * As ever for Mr Ghosh, language is a great tumasher, and it is not surprising that he is on the shortlist for the biennial Man Booker International Prize . . . He swims with relish in a lexicon he has made his own, a rich brew of English, Bangla, Hindi, Parsi, Malay, Cantonese and pidgin at a time when free trade and imperialism were recombining Asian cultures and tongues . . . Mr Ghosh&#39;s genius is to paint this world from its teeming heart, rather than from the perspective of metropolitan centres of power in London, or, for that matter, Peking * The Economist * Totally absorbing * Literary Review * For the past weeks, [Amitav Ghosh] has been holed up in his Goa home, putting the finishing touches to Flood of Fire, the third part of his epic Ibis trilogy. The project has taken a decade. The three novels, starting with Sea of Poppies . . . have cemented his reputation * Financial Times * A masterpiece . . . Flood of Fire is not just a work of literary imagination but also an exercise in deep and original historical reflection * Chris Clark, author of Sleepwalkers *</p><h2>Expect the Unexpected (Or You Won&#39;t Find It): A Creativity Tool Based on the Ancient Wisdom of Heraclitus</h2><p>Dipping deeply into the well of Western thought and history, the author recovers the 2,500-year-old philosophy of Heraclitus for modern users--particularly business executives--using his wisdom to help readers jump-start their own creativity.</p><p>The ancient Greek philosopher Heraclitus was the first "creativity teacher," says Roger von Oech, whose bestselling book <i>A Whack on the Side of the Head</i> set the standard for out-of-the-box thinking. In <i>Expect the Unexpected</i>, Von Oech uses 30 of Heraclitus's pithy and paradoxical epigrams to approach problems in a fresh manner. He explains his premise: "Creative thinking involves imagining familiar things in a new light, digging below the surface to find previously undetected patterns, and finding connections among unrelated phenomena."<p> Von Oech uses the epigrams as creativity exercises--accompanied by mental puzzles, anecdotes, questions, and punchy footnotes--to demonstrate that Heraclitus's 2,500-year-old creative insights have aged well. With his whimsical wand, von Oech transforms the epigram "A Donkey prefers garbage to gold" into an exploration of values. He uses Heraclitus's observation that "A wonderful harmony is created when we join together the seemingly unconnected" to examine the use of metaphors in understanding problems. When Heraclitus observes that "Dogs bark at what they don't understand," Von Oech crafts a meditation about criticism. Executives, students, teachers, and parents will find an exciting and entertaining map for changing thought patterns, tolerating ambiguity, confounding expectations, and searching for hidden meanings. --<i>Barbara Mackoff</i></p><b>Roger von Oech</b> is the founder and president of Creative Think, a California-based consulting firm that specializes in stimulating creativity and innovation.

Three weeks after their arrival, the country was gripped by a violent revolution trapping the Kistners in its midst. Despite having to find their way out of numerous life-threatening situations, the Kistners were not to be dissuaded. An emergency airlift by the United States Air Force brought them to safety in Kenya where they continued their field work.Thus began three decades of adventures in science. In <i>An Affair with Africa</i>, Alzada Kistner describes her family's African experience -- the five expeditions they took beginning with the trip to the Belgian Congo in 1960 and ending in 1972-73 with a nine-month excursion across southern Africa. From hunching over columns of ants for hours on end while seven months pregnant to eating dinner next to Idi Amin, Kistner provides a lively and humor-filled account of the human side of scientific discovery. Her wonderfully detailed stories clearly show why, despite hardship and danger -- and contrary to all of society's expectations -- she could not forsake accompanying her husband on his expeditions, and, to this day, continues to find the world "endlessly beckoning, a lively bubbling cauldron of questions and intrigue."In the spirit of Beryl Markham's <i>West with the Night</i> and Isak Dinesen's <i>Out of Africa</i>, <i>An Affair with Africa</i> shares with readers the thoughts and experiences of a remarkable woman, one whose unquenchable thirst for adventure led her into a series of almost unimaginable situations. Readers -- from armchair travelers fascinated by stories of Africa to scientists familiar with the Kistners's work but unaware of the lengths to which they went to gather their data -- will find <i>An Affair with Africa</i> a rare treasure.</p><p><p>Alzada Carlisle Kistner is associate editor of the journal <i>Sociobiology</i>, published by California State University in Chico, California. David Kistner is the world's leading authority on the rare beetles that live with ants and termites; he has described more than 500 new species and 150 new genera and written more than 200 scientific papers. <i>An Affair with Africa</i> is Alzada Carlisle Kistner's first book.</p>The adventures of a family spanning more than a decade of scientific expeditions to Africa in search of some of the tiniest of that continent's wildlife. Kistner, associate editor of the journal Sociobiology, is the gamely devoted wife of entomologist David Kistner, the world's foremost expert on myrmecophiles, beetles that live among ant colonies. Beginning in 1960, the young couple began an often harrowing but productive series of expeditions to Africa at a time when many Americans and Europeans were headed the other way to escape the instability of the end of the colonial era. In search of their small quarry, the Kistners, eventually with both of their young daughters in tow, spend long, dusty hours on all fours sucking up insectssometimes thousands in one sessionthrough an aspirator. But what readers will find more memorable in this unflaggingly cheery narrative are the family's frequent life-threatening encounters with both nature and man, from poisonous snakes and charging elephants (not to mention biting ants) to bandits and terrorists. They also experienced the last gasp of the European and especially British colonial period with its dinner parties, sumptuous houses, and colorful old Africa hands and colonial administrators. Then, too, the family by happenstance ran into some of the famous and infamous men who took their places, such as presidents Julius Nyerere of Tanzania and Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia, and in a brief but scary restaurant encounter, Ugandan dictator Idi Amin. Kistner tiptoes around the issue of apartheid in then Rhodesia and South Africa, only vaguely muttering her dissatisfaction with the policy and with white attitudes toward black Africans, but politics is only tangential to this account, which is really a rather remarkable family saga.

The process of simply existing is not necessarily meaningful. And yet, there is an unlimited potential for meaning and value in this human existence.

This book is an illustrated version of a rhymed alphabet made by Carolyn Wells in 1901. She felicitously finds something important about Christmas for each letter of the alphabet. Here is a sequence to give an idea of its flavor: &#34;E is for Evergreens cut for the room / F is for Flowers of exquisite perfume / G is for Gifts that bring us delight / H is for Holly with red berries bright&#34;. Published in 1989, we illustrated each rhyme with an antique image, including illustrators like Arthur Rackham, Sarah Stilwell, Jessie Willcox Smith, Oliver Herford, Anne Anderson, and Charles Robinson. It was published with great success by G.P. Putman.</p><p></p><h2>The Gardens of Versailles</h2><p>In 1990 a vast restoration project was initiated for the park at Versailles. This gigantic task aimed at returning the gardens, as closely as possible, to their original layout.<br>This book celebrates the event by presenting a detailed history of the gardens, from the hunting estate acquired by Louis XIII, to the park of today. Hundred of visitors are drawn here to appreciate the unique and sumptuous era when Versailles became the ultimate symbol of the legendary Sun King.<br>There followed, first, the age of Louis XV, when the Trianon became one of the favourite haunts of the Court, then the reign of Louis XVI, which saw its surroundings transformed into one of the most extraordinary jardin anglais produced in France during the eighteenth century. Throughout the nineteenth century, the gardens were maintained, restored and replanted, and today they are being further restored to their original state, reflecting the most significant contributions made by each of the preceding periods.<br>More than two hundred reproductions, plans, drawings, paintings and engravings, as well as colour photographs of the existing gardens, illustrate this book. Each is accompanied by a short explanation that encourages the reader to relive the centuries that reflect the gardens.</p><p>Pierre-Andre Lablaude is Architect-in-Chief of the Monuments Historiques.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>Fever Dream (Night Lights)</h2><p>A young boy&#39;s illness comes alive taking over his body bit by bit until he dies--but the virus remains alive in his body</p><p></p><h2>Fallen Heroes: Sixteen Master Villain Archetypes</h2><p>The villain is the hero of his own story - and is every bit as important as the heroic characters. This book contains the lectures and exercises from Tami Cowden&#39;s popular online class on villain archetypes. The workshop identifies and examines the motivations of the 16 literary villain archetypes, and shows what happens when heroes and heroines turn to the dark side. Here&#39;s what participants have said about the workshop: -I really enjoyed this class. Seeing these archetypes spelled out like this really gives perspective instinct does not. -Not only did this give me some really good tips on villain archetypes, but seeing the thought process behind creating a character for the archetypes helped me with your hero/heroine archetypes as well. -WONDERFUL class, again!!! It was quite a thrill figuring out which archetype matched up with the villianess of my WIP :) . I have your exclamation about motivation stuck to my wall, just as a reminder. --I did get a chance to apply this to my characters. I put a lot more thought into my characters&#39; motivations and I think I will have a stronger book for it. The workshop really helped me make a more consistant characters and to work through how my characters act. -I&#39;m having trouble getting a handle on my villain in my next book, and these archetypes are really helping me. -The exercises were enlightening as well as a fun way to get into the heads of these characters. - You have given me good ideas for use in my current WIP and I&#39;m certain I&#39;ll be using some of the others archetypes in future works.</p><p>Tami Cowden wanted to be a writer since she was a teenager.

Drawing on rich new evidence from correspondence and diaries, Jalland examines the lives of women in more than fifty British political families, recounting their experiences of courtship, marriage, and childbirth and the vital domestic and political functions they performed. With its numerous case studies and intimate approach to women&#39;s lives, this book is a welcome complement to the better known public history of women and the women&#39;s movement.</p><p>Pat Jalland is Visiting Fellow in History at the Australina National University, Canberra."the best and most unbiased kind of women's history ... careful scholarship with the readability of novels" <br><br>--The Times Literary Supplement<br><br>"Jalland's book strikingly illustrates the way break-through in research can result from suddenly perceiving significance in material that others have lightly discarded ... The outcome is a historical sociology without jargon and its lumps of undigested statistics, a social anthropology<br>without vague speculation, and a women's history that rests secure on a close and sensitive study of the interaction between the sexes. This is one of the best books on women's history to be published for years." <br><br>--The London Review of Books<br><br>"based on a close study of more than 50 British family archives ... Jalland's interest in the private dimension has uncovered an invaluable record of elite women's - and men's - private experience, which students will draw on for years to come ...

Yet peace continues to elude Horatio Hornblower overseas . . . As an admiral struggling to impose order in the chaotic aftermath of the French wars, Horatio Hornblower, Commander-in-chief of His Majesty&#39;s ships and vessels in the West Indies, must still face savage pirates, reckless revolutionaries and a violent hurricane. And while his retirement at half-pay might well be in sight, Hornblower will need every ounce of his rapier wit and quick thinking - not to mention his courage and leadership - to ensure that the lasting peace in Europe reaches the turbulent seas of the West Indies. This is the tenth of eleven books chronicling the adventures of C. S. Forester&#39;s inimitable nautical hero, Horatio Hornblower.</p><p>Hodder Headline Audiobooks presents abridged readings of some of the finest in drama, classic literature, popular fiction, poetry, children s stories, and religious and inspirational works.

He studied medicine at Guy&#39;s Hospital, and after leaving Guy&#39;s without a degree he turned to writing as a career. On the outbreak of war he entered the Ministry of Information and later he sailed with the Royal Navy to collect material for The Ship. He made a voyage to the Bering Sea to gather material for a similar book on the United States Navy, and it was during this trip that he was stricken with arteriosclerosis, a disease which left him crippled. However, he continued to write and in the Hornblower novels created the most renowned sailor in contemporary fiction.

He tells their stories and secrets, illuminating 150 years of American life along the way. Dan Bessie begins the journey through his family history with his great-grandfather in the cargo hold of a ship bound for New York on the storm-tossed Atlantic. What follows are stories of his grandfather's various entrepreneurial schemes (including a folding butter box business), a grandmother who was voted "New York's Prettiest Shop Girl" (and who resisted the recruitment efforts of various city madams), and his uncle Harry's Turnabout Theater in Los Angeles (a renowned puppet theater drawing patrons as diverse as Shirley Temple, Ray Bradbury, and Albert Einstein). Through inherited journals and literary effects, Bessie comes to a new understanding of his father, Alvah. An actor and writer, he fought in the Lincoln Brigade during the Spanish Civil War. When he returned to the States, he headed to the Warner back lots to begin a screenwriting career. But as congress began investigating radicals in the film industry, Alvah was blacklisted for his Communist sympathies and was soon sent to jail as one of the Hollywood Ten. His grandmother's cousin, Sidney Lenz, wrote Lenz on Bridge, a classic guide to the game of contract bridge. Bessie describes what was billed as the Bridge Battle of the Century, a 1931 match between Lenz and an upstart opponent that was covered by journalists from all over the world. Bessie's brother-in-law Wes Wilson designed rock and roll posters for the Fillmore Auditorium in San Francisco during the 1960s, living a counterculture existence vastly different from the bridge-mad Depression Era. Cousin Michael was heir to the compulsive storytelling characterizing many of the Bessies. He found his niche in publishing, co-founding the Atheneum Press and shaping books by people such as Anwar Sadat, Edward Albee, and Aldous Huxley. With an equally impressive career, Uncle Leo built the country's fifth largest advertising agency. A passion of a different sort led cousin Phoebe Snetsinger to travel from Webster Groves, Missouri, to the far corners of Africa and Asia. The world's leading birder, she sighted 8,400 different birds-nearly 85 percent of the species known to exist. An extraordinary strain of creativity runs through the Bessie and Burnett clans, and Rare Birds celebrates the colorful diversity of a remarkable and accomplished family. While their choices and professions run the gamut of the American experience in the twentieth century, the history of the nation can be traced in these people's lives. Bessie's passionate birds of a feather gather to sing their unique song across decades and generations.

As we intercede, we take the place of another&#x2014;loved one or stranger, individual or nation&#x2014;in prayer. If our primary motivation for prayer becomes interceding to achieve the results we desire, we will ultimately fail. But when we approach intercession as an opportunity to partner with our wonderful Father, and when we intercede with his will in mind, we draw into a deeper, more intimate relationship with God. We also find ourselves being used by God to make history and change lives.</p><p>Dutch Sheets is Senior Pastor of Springs Harvest Fellowship in Colorado Springs, CO.

The band rose to conquer the globe with a string of unforgettable hits such as "Rio," "Hungry Like the Wolf," and "The Reflex." With Simon Le Bon as their frontman, they were the defining pop act of the 1980s, but Andy Taylor, the enigmatic lead guitarist, is widely acknowledged to have been their musical driving force.<br><br>Then, at the very height of their achievement in 1985, Duran Duran imploded. Now Andy shares the story of what went wrong. With searing honesty, he charts every moment of Duran Duran's roller-coaster rise from their early days as club musicians through to international superstardom. He captures the glamour and excitement of the band's epic video shoots and the opulence of their world tours.<br><br>He reveals the truth about the allegations of drug abuse and wild hedonism that dogged Duran Duran. Packed with more than twenty-five years worth of rock 'n' roll anecdotes, Andy tells of his time in the band The Power Station, and explains why Duran Duran reformed with its original line-up in 2003. <br><br>But Wild Boy is also a moving story on a human level, as Andy describes how the pressures of fame took a terrible personal toll on him and his family. Moving from hilarious to harrowing at the turn of a page, WILD BOY is a must-read for anyone who lived through the 1980s, or who cares about music.</p><p>Andy Taylor was born in a small fishing village in the North East of England in 1961. He learned to play guitar at the age of eight and as a teenager he toured American airbases in Germany with a cover band, before joining Duran Duran in 1980. In the five years that followed, the band would have ten Top 10 UK hit singles and two #1 hit singles in the U.S. before he left, and have gone on to sell 100 million records worldwide. A hugely accomplished musician, having worked with artists as diverse as Robert Palmer, Rod Stewart, and Steve Jones of the Sex Pistols, Andy lives with his wife Tracey and their family in Ibiza.In this sincere though slight autobiography, Taylor, guitarist for the 1980s pop band Duran Duran, delivers an extended backstage look at the band's rise and fall. He includes an album-by-album look at how the band, which combined glam fashion and keyboard-driven synthpop with outrageous (and expensive) videos featuring exotic locales such as Sri Lanka, became synonymous with early MTV. Taylor discusses&#x2014;sometimes underplays&#x2014;the band's outrageous drug and alcohol habits&#x2014;much of which was better covered in MTV's 1999 <i>Behind The Music</i> segment. He is clearly aware that the band's materialistic image was a key part of London's transformation in the 1980s into a city where it was a dominant part of popular culture to aspire to be successful. The frustrating part is that his attempts to put Duran Duran into a wider musical perspective are far too infrequent, and his own story can't quite carry the narrative. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In this winner of the 2006 Green Rose Prize &#34;You can fairly hear the pinging of the world and all its parts-noises of earth&#39;s objects rubbing against each other and the spheres. In this ebullient music find the translation of colors, shapes, space, speech, integrity, destruction. It&#39;s as if the world&#39;s most believable cape were thrown back and below we found not a sham of seasons but all the body&#39;s most dynamic possibilities&#34;--Eleni Sikelianos.</p><p>Gordon is the&nbsp;co-publisher of Letter Machine&nbsp;Editions, and an assistant professor in the MFA program in Creative Writing at The University of Colorado-Boulder.With obfuscating cascades of images and precisely tumbling syntax, the 33 archly titled poems and sequences in Gordon's fourth collection attempt to assemble, sometimes like a computer running a poetic algorithm, a hallowed new world flush in art and music. Written with exactness (sonnet sequences, a series of seven line poems, anaphora, etc.), the pieces are thickly smattered with the bedrock and easy emotion of the deep image, the hipster-abstract, and bible-ese: "the sound of smoke // was that of expansion // but the breaking of bread // like a dusk-shadow // became a name // losing itself in echo." When Gordon (Novel Pictorial Noise, chosen by John Ashbery for the National Poetry Series) directs instead of alludes, wonderful harmonies accrete from these patterns: "forget almond trees, grapes &amp; poppies // what he wouldn't believe is the inescapable music here // the night filling with beloved firetrucks // cover your ears to cover the passing sirens // praise the passing sirens." An intellectual latitude is at work here: Gordon references Barthes, Holderlin, Novalis, Stein, Twombly and many others that shadow the cacophony here. If the reader is sometimes pushed away by all the activity, the verse that floats to the top can be stunning. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Since 1985 Janet's compositions have been featured in exhibitions world, - wide The Works Gallery in Philadelphia, Gayle Wilson Galleries, in the Hamptons, New York; Takashimaya, Tokyo and many others. &nbsp;Janet is also a lecturer and holds regular open workshops in the UK and is often invited to other countriesFor Bolton, scraps of fabric are imbued with memories capable of inspiring creativity and provoking imaginative musings. The images she creates with patchwork have a charm far greater than the basic craft techniques utilized, and although art school trained, Bolton retains a simplicity associated with self-taught artists. Many of the pieces shown here have the appeal and freshness of true folk art, so even though Bolton discusses elements of design throughout the text, a beginner need not be intimidated. All in all, this is a delightful primer that should interest a range of crafters coming from either a needlework or a painting orientation. Colorful illustrations complement Bolton's instructions on both stitchery and arranging motifs in attractive compositions. <i>Alice Joyce</i></p><h2>The Falcons of Montabard</h2><p><br>Barfleur, 1120. Sabin FitzSimon, bastard son of an earl, has acquired a reputation for wildness and trouble only matched by his abilities as a warrior. But when he is caught seducing the King's favorite mistress, not even his fighting skills can save him. Beaten by the King's soldieries and left behind in the Norman port, it seems that his notoriety has finally gotten the better of him.<br><br>Upon his eventual return to England, Sabin is given the opportunity to rebuild his career and salvage his reputation: The knight Edmund Strongfist is leaving for the Holy Land to offer his sword and services to the King of Jerusalem, and he wants Sabin to join him.<br> <br>Accompanying Strongfist is his young, beautiful, convent-educated daughter Annais. Sabin, he warns, is to keep away from her. Being grateful for the chance that Strongfist has given him, Sabin does so, but not without a feeling of regret as he observes her spirit and courage, and enjoys her beautiful harp playing.<br><br>The Holy Land brings its own shares of trials for Sabin. If he succeeds in keeping his distance from Annais, he has less success with Strongfist's new wife, and the consequences prove to be painful. The land is suffering from constant warfare and following the capture of the King, Sabin is forced to take command of the fortress of Montabard and marry its recently widowed chatelaine.

His books are published in forty-three languages around the globe and have been number one bestsellers in more than a dozen countries. The winner of the Edgar, Shamus, and Anthony Awards, he lives in New Jersey.Scott Duncan sat across from the killer.<p>The windowless room of thundercloud gray was awkward and still, stuck in that the lull when the music first starts and neither stranger is sure how to begin the dance. Scott tried a noncommittal nod. The killer, decked out in prison-issue orange, simply stared. Scott folded his hands and put them on the metal table. The killer&#x2014;his file said he was Monte Scanlon, but there was no way that was his real name&#x2014;might have done likewise had his hands not been cuffed. Why, Scott wondered yet again, am I here?</p><p>His specialty was prosecuting corrupt politicians&#x2014;something of a vigorous cottage industry in his home state of New Jersey&#x2014;but three hours ago, Monte Scanlon, a mass executioner by any standards, had finally broken his silence to make a demand.</p><p>That demand?</p><p>A private meeting with Assistant U.S. Attorney Scott Duncan.</p><p>This was strange for a large variety of reasons, but here were two: one, a killer should not be in a position to make demands; two, Scott had never met or even heard of Monte Scanlon.</p><p>Scott broke the silence. &#x201c;You asked to see me?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;</p><p>Scott nodded, waited for him to say more. He didn&#x2019;t. &#x201c;So what can I do for you?&#x201d;</p><p>Monte Scanlon maintained the stare. &#x201c;Do you know why I&#x2019;m here?&#x201d;</p><p>Scott glanced around the room. Besides Scanlon and himself, four people were present. Linda Morgan, the United States attorney, leaned against the back wall trying to give off the ease of Sinatra against a lamppost. Standing behind the prisoner were two beefy, nearly identical prison guards with tree-stump arms and chests like antique armoires. Scott had met the two cocky agents before, had seen them go about their task with the sereneness of yoga instructors. But today, with this well-shackled prisoner, even these guys were on edge. Scanlon&#x2019;s lawyer, a ferret reeking of checkout-counter cologne, rounded out the group. All eyes were on Scott.</p><p>&#x201c;You killed people,&#x201d; Scott answered. &#x201c;Lots of them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I was what is commonly called a hit man. I was&#x201d;&#x2014;Scanlon paused&#x2014;&#x201c;an assassin for hire.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;On cases that don&#x2019;t involve me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;True.&#x201d;</p><p>Scott&#x2019;s morning had started off normal enough. He&#x2019;d been drafting a subpoena on a waste- disposal executive who was paying off a small-town mayor. Routine matter. Everyday graft in the Garden State of New Jersey. That had been, what, an hour, an hour and a half ago? Now he sat across the bolted-down table from a man who had murdered&#x2014;according to Linda Morgan&#x2019;s rough estimate&#x2014;one hundred people.</p><p>&#x201c;So why did you ask for me?&#x201d;</p><p>Scanlon looked like an aging playboy who might have squired a Gabor sister in the fifties. He was small, wizened even. His graying hair was slicked back, his teeth cigarette-yellow, his skin leathery from midday sun and too many long nights in too many dark clubs. No one in the room knew his real name. When captured, his passport read Monte Scanlon, an Argentinean national, age fifty-one. The age seemed about right, but that would be about it. His fingerprints had not popped up in the NCIC computer banks. Facial recognition software had come up with a big goose egg.</p><p>&#x201c;We need to speak alone.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;This is not my case,&#x201d; Scott said again. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a U.S. attorney assigned to you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;This has nothing to do with her.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And it does with me?&#x201d;</p><p>Scanlon leaned forward. &#x201c;What I&#x2019;m about to tell you,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;will change your entire life.&#x201d;</p><p>Part of Scott wanted to wiggle his fingers in Scanlon&#x2019;s face and say, &#x201c;Ooooo.&#x201d; He was used to the captured criminal mindset&#x2014;their serpentine maneuverings, their quest for an edge, their search for a way out, their overblown sense of importance. Linda Morgan, perhaps sensing his thoughts, shot a warning glare across his bow. Monte Scanlon, she&#x2019;d told him, had worked for various connected families for the better part of thirty years. RICO hungered for his cooperation in a starving-man-near-a-buffet way. Since his capture, Scanlon had refused to talk. Until this morning.</p><p>So here Scott was.</p><p>&#x201c;Your boss,&#x201d; Scanlon said, gesturing with his chin at Linda Morgan, &#x201c;she hopes for my cooperation.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to get the needle,&#x201d; Morgan responded, still trying to give off the scent of nonchalance. &#x201c;Nothing you say or do will change that.&#x201d;</p><p>Scanlon smiled. &#x201c;Please. You fear losing what I have to say much greater than I fear death.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Right. Another tough guy who doesn&#x2019;t fear death.&#x201d; She peeled herself off the wall. &#x201c;Know what, Monte? The tough guys are always the ones who soil their pants when we strap them to the gurney.&#x201d;</p><p>Again Scott fought off the desire to wiggle his fingers, this time at his boss. Scanlon kept smiling. His eyes never left Scott&#x2019;s. Scott didn&#x2019;t like what he saw. They were, as one would expect, black and shiny and cruel. But&#x2014;and Scott might have been imagining things&#x2014;maybe he saw something else there. Something beyond the standard vacancy. There seemed to be a pleading in the eyes; Scott couldn&#x2019;t turn away from them. There was regret there maybe.</p><p>Remorse even.</p><p>Scott looked up at Linda and nodded. She frowned, but Scanlon had called her bluff. She touched one of the beefy guards on the shoulder and gestured for them to leave. Rising from his seat, Scanlon&#x2019;s lawyer spoke for the first time. &#x201c;Anything he says is off the record.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Stay with them,&#x201d; Scanlon ordered. &#x201c;I want you to make sure that they don&#x2019;t listen in.&#x201d;</p><p>The lawyer picked up his briefcase and followed Linda Morgan to the door. Soon Scott and Scanlon were alone. In the movies, killers are omnipotent. In real life, they are not. They don&#x2019;t escape from handcuffs in the middle of a high-security federal penitentiary. The Beef Brothers, Scott knew, would be behind the one-way glass. The intercom, per Scanlon&#x2019;s instructions, would be off. But they&#x2019;d all be watching.</p><p>Scott shrugged a well? at him.</p><p>&#x201c;I am not your typical assassin for hire.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Uh huh.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I have rules.&#x201d;</p><p>Scott waited.</p><p>&#x201c;For example, I only kill men.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Wow,&#x201d; Scott said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re a prince.&#x201d;</p><p>Scanlon ignored the sarcasm. &#x201c;That is my first rule. I kill only men. No women.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Right. Tell me, does rule two have anything to do with not putting out until the third date?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You think I&#x2019;m a monster?&#x201d;</p><p>Scott shrugged as if the answer was obvious.</p><p>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t respect my rules?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What rules? You kill people. You make up these so-called rules because you need the illusion of being human.&#x201d;</p><p>Scanlon seemed to consider that. &#x201c;Perhaps,&#x201d; he allowed, &#x201c;but the men I&#x2019;ve killed were scum. I was hired by scum to kill scum. I am no more than a weapon.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A weapon?&#x201d; Scott repeated.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A weapon doesn&#x2019;t care who it kills, Monte. Men, women, grannies, little kids. A weapon doesn&#x2019;t differentiate.&#x201d;</p><p>Scanlon smiled. &#x201c;Touch�.&#x201d;</p><p>Scott rubbed his palms on his pant legs. &#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t call me here for an ethics class. What do you want?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re divorced, aren&#x2019;t you, Scott?&#x201d;</p><p>He said nothing.</p><p>&#x201c;No children, amicable split, still friendly with the ex.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What do you want?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;To explain.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;To explain what?&#x201d;</p><p>He lowered his eyes but only for a moment. &#x201c;What I did to you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t even know you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But I know you. I&#x2019;ve known you for a long time.&#x201d;</p><p>Scott let the silence in. He glanced at the mirror. Linda Morgan would be behind the glass, wondering what they were talking about. She wanted information. He wondered if they had the room bugged. Probably. Either way, it would pay to keep Scanlon talking.</p><p>&#x201c;You are Scott Duncan. Thirty-nine years old. You graduated from Columbia Law School. You could be making a great deal more money in private practice, but that bores you. You&#x2019;ve been with the U.S. attorney&#x2019;s office six months. Your mother and father moved to Miami last year. You had a sister, but she died in college.&#x201d;</p><p>Scott shifted in his seat. Scanlon studied him.</p><p>&#x201c;You finished?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do you know how my business operates?&#x201d;</p><p>Change of subject. Scott waited a beat. Scanlon was playing a head game, trying to keep him off balance or some such nonsense. Scott was not about to fall for it. Nothing he had &#x201c;revealed&#x201d; about Scott&#x2019;s family was surprising. A person could pick up most of that info with a few well- placed keystrokes and phone calls.</p><p>&#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you tell me,&#x201d; Scott said.</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s pretend,&#x201d; Scanlon began, &#x201c;that you wanted someone dead.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You would contact a friend, who knows a friend, who knows a friend, who can reach me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And only that last friend would know you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Something like that. I had only one go-between man, but I was careful even with him. We never met face to face. We used code names. The payments always went to offshore accounts. I would open a new account for every, shall we say, transaction, and I closed it as soon as the transaction was completed. You still with me?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not that complicated,&#x201d; Scott said.</p><p>&#x201c;No, I guess not. But you see, nowadays we communicate by e-mail. I&#x2019;ll set up a temporary e- mail account with Hotmail or Yahoo! or whatever, with fake names. Nothing that can be traced back. But even if it could, even if you could find out who sent it, where would it lead you? All e- mails were sent and read at libraries or public places. We were totally covered.&#x201d;</p><p>Scott was about to mention that this total coverage had eventually landed Scanlon&#x2019;s ass in jail, but he decided to save it. &#x201c;What does this have to do with me?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m getting to that.&#x201d; Scott could see that Scanlon was warming up to his own tale. &#x201c;In the old days&#x2014;when I say old days, I mean, eight, ten years ago&#x2014;we did it mostly with pay phones. I&#x2019;d never see the name written. The guy would just tell me over the phone.&#x201d;</p><p>Scanlon stopped and made sure that he had Scott&#x2019;s full attention. His tone softened a bit, became less matter-of-fact. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the key, Scott. It was by phone. I&#x2019;d only hear the name on the phone, not see it.&#x201d;</p><p>He looked at Scott expectantly. Scott had no idea what he was trying to say, so he went, &#x201c;Uh huh.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do you understand why I&#x2019;m stressing that it was done by phone?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Because a person like me, a person with rules, could make a mistake with the phone.&#x201d;</p><p>Scott thought about that. &#x201c;I still don&#x2019;t get it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I never kill women. That was rule number one.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So you said.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So if you wanted to put a hit on someone named Billy Smith, I&#x2019;d figure Billy was a man. You know, with a y. I&#x2019;d never think Billy would be a woman. With an ie at the end. You understand?&#x201d; Scott went very still. Scanlon saw it. He dropped the smile. His voice was very soft.</p><p>&#x201c;We talked before about your sister, didn&#x2019;t we, Scott?&#x201d;</p><p>Scott did not respond.</p><p>&#x201c;Her name was Geri, am I right?&#x201d;</p><p>Silence.</p><p>&#x201c;You see the problem, Scott? Geri is one of those names. If you heard it on the phone, you&#x2019;d assume it would be with a J in the front and a y at the end. So fifteen years ago, I got a phone call. From that go-between man I told you about....&#x201d;</p><p>Scott shook his head.</p><p>&#x201c;I was given an address. I was told exactly what time &#x2018;Jerry&#x2019;&#x201d;&#x2014;Scanlon made quote marks with his fingers&#x2014;&#x201c;would be home.&#x201d;</p><p>Scott&#x2019;s own voice seemed to come from very far away. &#x201c;It was ruled an accident.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Most arsons are, if you know what you&#x2019;re doing.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t believe you.&#x201d;</p><p>But Scott looked at the eyes again and felt his world teeter. The images flooded in: Geri&#x2019;s contagious smile, the unruly hair, the braces, the way she stuck her tongue out at him during family gatherings. He remembered her first real boyfriend (a dork named Brad), her not getting a date to the junior prom, the gung-ho speech she made when she ran for student council treasurer, her first rock band (they were awful), her college acceptance letter.</p><p>Scott felt his eyes well up. &#x201c;She was only twenty-one.&#x201d;</p><p>No response.</p><p>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t get into the whys, Scott. I&#x2019;m just a hired hand&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, not that.&#x201d; Scott looked up. &#x201c;Why are you telling me this now?&#x201d;</p><p>Scanlon studied his reflection the mirror. His voice was very quiet. &#x201c;Maybe you were right.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Right about what?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What you said before.&#x201d; He head turned back toward Scott. &#x201c;Maybe after all is said and done, I need the illusion of being human.&#x201d;<br><br><i>chapter 1</i><br><br>There are sudden rips. There are tears in your life, deep knife wounds that slash through your flesh. Your life is one thing, then it is shredded into another. It comes apart as though gutted in a belly slit. And then there are those moments when your life simply unravels. A loose thread pulled. A seam gives way. The change is slow at first, nearly imperceptible.</p><p>For Grace Lawson, the unraveling began at the Photomat.</p><p>She was about to enter the photo developing shop when she heard a somewhat familiar voice. &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you get a digital camera, Grace?&#x201d;</p><p>Grace turned toward the woman. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not good with that techno stuff.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, come now. Digital technology is a snap.&#x201d; The woman raised her hand and actually snapped, just in case Grace didn&#x2019;t know what the word meant. &#x201c;And digital cameras are sooo much more convenient than conventional cameras. You just erase the photos you don&#x2019;t want. Like computer files. For our Christmas card? Barry, well, he must have taken a zillion pictures of the kids, you know, snapping away because Blake blinked or Kyle was looking the wrong way, whatever, but when you shoot that many, well, like Barry says, you&#x2019;re going to get one that&#x2019;s pretty decent, am I right?&#x201d;</p><p>Grace nodded. She was trying to unearth the woman&#x2019;s name, but it wouldn&#x2019;t surface. The woman&#x2019;s daughter&#x2014;Blake, was it?&#x2014;was in Grace&#x2019;s son&#x2019;s class in first grade. Or maybe it was last year in kindergarten. Hard to keep track. Grace kept the smile frozen to her face. The woman was nice enough, but she blended in with the others. Grace wondered, not for the first time, if she was blending in too, if her once great individuality had joined the unpleasant swirl of suburban uniformity.</p><p>The thought was not a comforting one.</p><p>The woman kept describing the wonders of the digital age. Grace&#x2019;s frozen smile began to ache. She glanced at her watch, hoping Tech Mom would pick up the hint. Two-forty-five. Almost time to pick up Max at school. Emma had swim team practice, but another mom was driving the carpool today. A carpool to the pool, as the too-jolly mother had reminded Grace with a little tee- hee. Yeah, funny stuff.</p><p>&#x201c;We have to get together,&#x201d; the woman said, winding down. &#x201c;With Jack and Barry. I think they&#x2019;d get along.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Definitely.&#x201d;</p><p>Grace took advantage of the pause to wave good-bye, pull open the door, and disappear inside the Photomat. The glass door closed with a snap, ringing a little bell. The chemical smell, not unlike model glue, hit her first. She wondered about the long-term effects of working in such an environment and decided the short-term ones were annoying enough.</p><p>The kid working&#x2014;Grace&#x2019;s use of the term working being overly generous here&#x2014;behind the counter had a white fuzz pellet under his chin, hair dyed a color that&#x2019;d intimidate Crayola, and enough piercings to double as a wind instrument. One of those wrap-around-low headphones snaked around the back of his neck. The music was so loud that Grace could feel it in her ...</p></p><h2>Play the Sicilian Kan: A Dynamic And Flexible Repertoire For Black</h2><p><p>The Kan is an ideal choice against 1 e4, as it is one of the easiest variations of the Sicilian to learn and play.

Reprint.</p><p>Richard Laymon has an MA in English Literature from Loyola University, LA. After a variety of jobs, he now works full-time as a writer and lives with his wife and daughter.Published last year in the U.K. as Amara, this exuberantly entertaining horror novel is grade-A Laymon, certainly his strongest to be issued stateside since his death in 2001. (When the market for his novels dried up here in the 1990s, this critically neglected author continued to publish and to sell well both in the U.K. and Australia.) As is often the case with Laymon, three plot strands loop through the narrative, braiding at novel's end to garrote the reader. The three are the murderous rampage of a resurrected female mummy in southern California (this plot line also includes an exciting first-person reminiscence set in 1926 Egypt by the man who excavates the mummy from its tomb); the nighttime meditations of a lonely young blind woman in California; and the ordeals of assorted victims kidnapped to an underground prison where they are sexually abused, sometimes slain, by unseen predators when the lights go out. The plot thread involving the mummy is the least interesting, because the staggering ferocious monster at its core shows as little character as the mummies of old Universal horror flicks; she's simply a force to be fought, though Laymon raises plenty of goose pimples here. The meditations of the blind woman sound a sad note that reverberates throughout and deepens the surrounding horrors; and truly amazing-inventive and transgressive-are the scenes set in the underground chamber, tours de force of pitch-black horror. Like all good Laymon novels, this one hurtles from start to finish-never mind the large cast and tripartite plot-and as in all Laymons, the sex, violence and violent sex will leave even jaded readers gasping.

It's demons, depowerment and drama when the Defenders discover the true secret of Omega and his mysterious charge! Plus, the death of a super-villain who, so far, is still dead! When was the last time you saw that? Guest-starring Spider-Man (if you look closely enough)! <br><br><b>Collecting:</b> <i>Omega: The Unknown #1-10</i> and <i>Defenders #76-77</i> -- written by Steve Gerber, Mary Skrenes, Scott Edelman, Roger Stern, Steven Grant, and Mark Gruenwald; and illustrated by Jim Mooney, Lee Elias, and Herb Trimpe.</p><p>In the 1970s, a number of young writers tried to shake up superhero comics by using them to voice real-world concerns. Foremost among these mavericks was Gerber, whose <i>Howard the Duck</i> became a cult phenomenon. He was less successful with the ambitious <i>Omega the Unknown</i>, which maintained two parallel story lines, one featuring mysterious, mute, superhuman Omega, who comes to Earth to escape his war-torn planet; and the other focused on orphaned, emotionless, 12-year-old genius James-Michael Starling, placed in foster care in Hell's Kitchen. As Omega fights superpowered villains and James-Michael contends with school bullies and inner city life, we learn more about their backgrounds and hidden connection. Too odd and ponderous to find commercial success, and not helped by pedestrian artwork,<i> Omega</i> was cancelled after 10 issues, and another writer tied up its loose ends none-too-satisfactorily in two issues of <i>Defenders</i>, which yet are included in this collection. <i>Omega</i> is fondly remembered by many, including novelist Jonathan Lethem, who has announced plans to revive it. <i>Gordon Flagg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association. All rights reserved</i>"Gerber and Skrenes' unfinished masterpiece, <i>Omega the Unknown</i> was one of the most offbeat tales of a very offbeat decade for comics. A young boy discovers that he was being raised by robots. After their destruction, he then discovers some sort of connection with a powerful (and oddly silent) alien--but the boy has mysterious powers similar to the alien! The alien tends to show up when the boy is in trouble. It is a strange book." -- <i>Brian Cronin </i><br><br>"<i>Omega The Unknown</i>, though an unfinished symphony, is criminally overlooked. In its mix of kitchen sink realism and high flying fantasy, its puzzling ponderables and its imponderable puzzles, it was both an enigma in a puzzle box and drama exploring and exposing the human condition. And though the Defenders issues are unsatisfying in comparison...they at least offer the saga a token ending. And what there is of it...is quite unique. No wonder it haunts some people still." -- <i>pulpanddagger.com</i></p><h2>War to the Knife: Bleeding Kansas, 1854-1861</h2><p>A powerful narrative of the border war between proslavery Missouri and free-state Kansas as prologue to the American Civil War.</p><p>"A violent tale of insurrection, rioting, drunkenness, principle, politics, and self-interest. . . . Goodrich has made effective use of sources from the state archives to present a coherent and credible vision of the dress rehearsal for the Civil War."&#x2014;Library Journal. "A high-decibel retelling of the story of sectional strife in the settling of Kansas. . . . An absorbing chronicle of surface events."&#x2014;Journal of American History. <p>Long before the secession crisis at Fort Sumter ignited the War between the States, men fought and died on the prairies of Kansas over the incendiary issue of slavery. "War to the knife and knife to the hilt," cried the Atchison Squatter Sovereign. </p><p>In 1854 a shooting war developed between proslavery men from Missouri and free-staters in Kansas over control of the territory. The prize was whether Kansas would become a slave or a free state when admitted to the Union, a question that could decide the balance of power in Washington. War to the Knife is an absorbing account of a bloody episode in our nation's past, told in the unforgettable words of the men and women involved: Robert E. Lee, William Tecumseh Sherman, Sara Robinson, Jeb Stuart, Abraham Lincoln, William F. Cody, and John Brown&#x2014;hailed as a prophet by some, denounced as a madman by others. </p><p>Because the conflict soon spread east, events in "Bleeding Kansas" have largely been forgotten. But as historian Thomas Goodrich reveals in this compelling saga, what America's "first civil war" lacked in numbers, it more than made up for in ferocity. </p><p>Thomas Goodrich is the author of Black Flag: Guerrilla Warfare on the Western Border, 1861&#x2013;1865 and the coauthor of The Day Dixie Died: Southern Occupation, 1865&#x2013;1866.</p>Thomas Goodrich is a professional writer whose focus is the American West.

By that time they and everyone else who had been at the scene of Custer's defeat were part of legend. Captain Frederick W. Benteen of the Seventh Cavalry made history on June 25 and 26, 1876, when he came to the rescue of Major Marcus A. Reno's command. Private Theodore W. Goldin was with Reno during the battle and later helped to bury Custer and his comrades. Benteen and Goldin had retired from the army when their correspondence--rare for being between an officer and an enlisted man--began.&nbsp;Benteen's letters, collected by John M. Carroll, are an exciting record of the Battle of the Little Big Horn and the Sioux War with tantalizing (and sometimes malicious) views of Custer and his wife, Libby; Reno; Generals Miles and Terry; and others. Goldin's replies to Benteen are lost, but Carroll has supplied revealing letters from him to the historians E. A. Brininstool and Fred Dustin touching on the same events. Also included are two accounts of the Battle of the Little Big Horn by Benteen, discovered after his death in 1898. <i>The Benteen-Goldin Letters on Custer and His Last Battle</i>, published in a limited edition in 1974 and edited and introduced by Carroll, is an important primary source for anyone interested in Custer.&nbsp;</p><p>John M.

Varnum</i> (also a Bison Book) and many other works.</p><h2>Penguin English Library the Last Chronicle of Barset</h2><p>The Penguin English Library Edition of The Last Chronicle of Barset by Anthony Trollope &#34;He is so scandalously weak, and she is so radically vicious, that they cannot but be wrong together. The very fact that such a man should be a bishop among us is to me terribly strong evidence of evil days coming&#34; When Reverend Josiah Crawley, the impoverished curate of Hogglestock, is accused of theft it causes a public scandal, sending shockwaves through the world of Barsetshire. The Crawleys desperately try to remain dignified while they are shunned by society, but the scandal threatens to tear them, and the community, apart. Drawing on his own childhood experience of genteel poverty, Trollope gives a painstakingly realistic depiction of the trials of a family striving to maintain its standards at all costs. With its sensitive portrayal of the proud and self-destructive figure of Crawley, this final volume is the darkest and most complex of all the Barsetshire novels. The Penguin English Library - 100 editions of the best fiction in English, from the eighteenth century and the very first novels to the beginning of the First World War.</p><p>Anthony Trollope (1815-82) was one of the most widely enjoyed and prolific novelists of the nineteenth century. His books include the great Chronicles of Barsetshire, of which The Last Chronicle of Barset is the final volume. Trollope worked for the Post Office for much of his adult life where he was instrumental in the creation of the red British pillar box. The other five titles in the Chronicles of Barsetshire are The Warden, Barchester Towers, Dr Thorne, Framley Parsonage and The Small House at Allington, all of which are published in the Penguin English Library.</p><h2>Germans and Texans: Commerce, Migration, and Culture in the Days of the Lone Star Republic</h2><p><p>During the brief history of the Republic of Texas (1836-1845), over 10,000 Germans emigrated to Texas. Perhaps best remembered today are the farmers who settled the Texas Hill Country, yet many of the German immigrants were merchants and businesspeople who helped make Galveston a thriving international port and Houston an early Texas business center. This book tells their story.</p><p>Drawing on extensive research on both sides of the Atlantic, Walter Struve explores the conditions that led nineteenth-century Europeans to establish themselves on the North American frontier. In particular, he traces the similarity in social, economic, and cultural conditions in Germany and the Republic of Texas and shows how these similarities encouraged German emigration and allowed some immigrants to prosper in their new home. Particularly interesting is the translation of a collection of letters from Charles Giesecke to his brother in Germany which provide insight into the business and familial concerns of a German merchant and farmer.</p><p>This wealth of information illuminates previously neglected aspects of intercontinental migration in the nineteenth century. The book will be important reading for a wide public and scholarly audience.</p></p><p>Walter Struve is Professor of History at the City University of New York.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>Dreamwatcher</h2><p>When Dierdre Vale refuses to use her ability to monitor the dreams of others in the case of a woman deemed harmful to national security, she finds herself locked in conflict with another powerful dreamwatcher</p><p>Theodore Roszak is the author of The Making of a Counter Culture, Where The Wasteland Ends, Voice of the Earth, and The Cult of Information.

Grounded in three sites&#x2014;the Cheslatta-Carrier traditional territory in British Columbia; the Wakarusa Wetlands in northeastern Kansas; and the Waitangi Treaty Grounds in Aotearoa/New Zealand&#x2014;this book highlights the challenging, tentative, and provisional work of coexistence around such contested spaces as wetlands, treaty grounds, fishing spots, recreation areas, cemeteries, heritage trails, and traditional village sites. At these sites, activists learn how to articulate and defend their intrinsic and life-supportive ways of being, particularly to those who are intent on damaging or destroying these places.&nbsp;</p><p>Using ethnographic research and a geographic perspective, Soren C. Larsen and Jay T. Johnson show how the communities in these regions challenge the power relations that structure the ongoing (post)colonial encounter in liberal democratic settler-states. Emerging from their conversations with activists was a distinctive sense that the places for which they cared had agency, a &#x201c;call&#x201d; that pulled them into dialogue, relationships, and action with human and nonhuman others. This being-together-in-place, they find, speaks in a powerful way to the vitalities of coexistence: where humans and nonhumans are working to decolonize their relationships; where reciprocal guardianship is being stitched back together in new and unanticipated ways; and where a new kind of &#x201c;place thinking&#x201d; is emerging on the borders of colonial power.</p></p><p><p>Soren C.

By the author of The Raphael Affair.</p><p>Iain Pears was born in 1955. Educated at Wadham College, Oxford, he has worked as a journalist, an art historian, and a television consultant in England, France, Italy, and the United States. He is the author of seven highly praised detective novels, a book of art history, and countless articles on artistic, financial, and historical subjects, as well as the international bestseller <b>An Instance of the Fingerpost</b> He lives in Oxford, England.Flavia di Stefano, junior investigator for the Polizia Art Squad of Rome, has been sent to Venice to assist (actually, to inoffensively not assist) the local carabinieri looking into the murder of American art historian Louise Masterson; Jonathan Argyll, the gawky British dealer's representative Flavia arrested in The Raphael Affair (1992), has come to Venice to negotiate for a mediocre painting with the Marchesa di Mulino, who suddenly turns skittish. The two cases cross with the news that Masterson's committee to authenticate all known works of Titian had run aground on serious disagreements (how serious? Two more committee members will soon be found dead) and that Masterson herself had developed a mysterious interest in the canvas Jonathan was trying to buy--part of the inheritance of the Marchesa's nephew Dr. Lorenzo, another member of the ill-starred Titian committee. As before, literate and cultivated, with a 20's (1520's) cast, and a particularly clever historical analogy saved for dessert. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Editor Paul Maher, one of the leading young lions of Kerouac scholarship, has scoured newspapers to glean interviews unseen for decades.<br><br>Although many top-notch journalists, from Mike Wallace to William F.

Written in 1879, this promotional piece claimed Eureka to be the second most important town in Nevada and touted its many virtues: the most prosperous mines in the state; telegraph, stagecoach, and railroad service; handsome new buildings; and plenty of water. To further embellish the town's image and lend some sophistication, local purveyors and businessmen advertised their wares at the end of the book.&nbsp;<i>Eureka and Its Resources</i>&nbsp;is a typical example of the many promotional pieces written in the early days of the West.

In such moments of apparently clear choices, the real alternatives are most hidden. <i>Welcome to the Desert of the Real</i> steps back, complicating the choices imposed on us. It proposes that global capitalism is fundamentalist and that America was complicit in the rise of Muslim fundamentalism. It points to our dreaming about the catastrophe in numerous disaster movies before it happened, and explores the irony that the tragedy has been used to legitimize torture.

Entwined with the story of Olivia's quest is that of the ill-starred romance between her ravishing daughter, Maya, and the wealthy young Englishman Christian Pendlebury, son of a ruthless and sophisticated British official. Like the rest of proper colonial society, Sir Jasper Pendlebury has severe doubts about Maya, despite her immense wealth and impeccable taste, because of her mixed heritage and her father's reputation. Meanwhile, prominent among a tangle of subplots are the calculated machinations of firebrand newspaper editor Kyle Hawkesworth, and a feud between Olivia's two sons. Throughout, the characters are drawn boldly, if simply, and the action is narrated in fancifully overblown prose: "It seemed ironic that so simple an epitaph and so modest a grave in this tranquil niche of some distant, undisturbed forest should mark the passing of a life as complex and turbulent as that of Jai Raventhorne." After many emotional cliffhangers, each character gets precisely what he or she deserves in a series of contrived, though satisfying, resolutions. It's easy enough to root for underdogs as romantic and put-upon as the dashing Raventhornes?so most readers will be pleased to find that Ryman has left plenty of room for another installment in that family's turbulent history. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.From the pseudonymous Indian author of Olivia and Jai (LJ 8/90) comes another romantic epic set in 19th-century India.

Good, A very good, clean, copy.</p><p><p>How do I forgive?</p><p>Nobel laureate Archbishop Desmond Tutu has witnessed some of the worst crimes people can inflict on others. So wherever he goes, he inevitably gets asked this question. This book is his answer. Writing with his daughter, Mpho, an Anglican priest, they lay out the simple but profound truths about the significance of forgiveness, how it works, why everyone needs to know how to grant it and receive it, and why granting forgiveness is the greatest gift we can give to ourselves when we have been wronged.</p><p>They explain the four-step process of forgiveness&#x2014;Telling the Story, Naming the Hurt, Granting Forgiveness, and Renewing or Releasing the Relationship&#x2014;as well as offer meditations, exercises, and prayers to guide the reader along the way.</p><p>"With each act of forgiveness, whether small or great, we move toward wholeness," they write.

Useful, informative letters from Larungu place the stories in context, briefly describe the Hausa and Ashanti cultures (the latter more thoroughly than the former), and elaborate upon the dominant themes. Several of the selections explain the origins of animals and peoples, while others are meant to teach young listeners about proper conduct. The stories are written in free verse, each beginning and ending in a traditional manner that provides authenticity and insight into oral storytelling. By presenting two traditions and several key themes, this volume gives a fuller background to West African folklore than single-story books, and most of the tales have enough tension to sustain interest. However, while the layout is attractive, with sufficient white space, many of the illustrations seem more inspired by fantasy than reality. Some experts may question the author's use of the outdated word ``tribe,'' and the title is misleading. The Hausa live principally in Nigeria and not Ghana, and the book is not only for ``African-American cultures,'' but for everyone. Children will appreciate these stories and gain greater understanding of the communities from which they originate. --Lyn Miller-Lachmann, Siena College Library, Loudonville, NY<br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>What Every American Should Know About American History: 200 Events that Shaped the Nation</h2><p>Brief essays describe two hundred pivotal events that shaped the history of the United States, from Leif Ericson&#39;s exploration of Vinland to the end of the Cold War and the Rodney King incident</p><p>If you've ever thought American history was as dry as the dust on an old battlefield, guess again. This engaging collection of 200 bite-sized-yet-satisfying descriptions of pivotal events includes "Leif Ericson Explores Vinland," "The American Revolution Begins," "Montgomery Ward Starts a Mail-order Business," &amp;quotBetty Friedan Publishes <i>The Feminine Mystique</i>," and "The Cold War Ends." As Axelrod and Phillips state in their introduction, "all are events any American should know about and appreciate to understand fully his or her own pursuit of happiness, the foundation of that elusive American dream so often celebrated in our literature and so seldom fulfilled in our history." And what about the 201st event? The afterword offers the Gulf War, the Rodney King trial, and even Johnny Carson's retirement from the <i>Tonight Show</i> as candidates. As the authors explain, "Significant events are more often like good wines; they age well and taste better later."Similar in concept as well as title to John Garraty's 1,001 Things Everyone Should Know About American History ( LJ 4/1/89), this volume continues the present fast-food approach to digesting American history. Here 200 events, arranged chronologically from "Leif Ericson Explores Vinland" to "The Cold War Ends," are described with the hopes of creating a "usable past" rather than a continuous narrative of facts. Some headings, such as "George Washington Carver Invents Peanut Butter," may trivialize the broader sociological discussions that follow. Each entry consists of a brief statement of the event followed by a historical overview of its import and influence on American thought and culture. These range in length from a few paragraphs to a few pages and are cogently written, concisely thorough, and admirably informative. A nine-page select bibliography concludes the volume. Despite its attractive price tag, this book should be viewed merely as a starting point for answers to specific questions on American history.

A few dishes, sporting names such as Texas chuckwagon chili and hot-off-the-grill burger chili, are fairly standard, but when Kolpas launches off into poultry, seafood and vegetable chilis, convention counts for little. Consider his swordfish steak, marinated, grilled and served with a sauce of broth, cannelini beans and mild chilies--only a tenuous connection to chili but an easy, tasty dinner. It's the same with orange and raisin chicken chili, a light and conspicuously sweet combination with a bit of hotness. Even the vegetarian chilies have a certain panache about them, with dishes like sun-dried tomato and white bean chili. In addition to his own creations, Kolpas has collected ideas from restaurants. Most are upscale, like the Muscovy duck chili from the chef at Wolfgang Puck's chic Los Angeles pub, Eureka, but there is also a Fritos pie from a Woolworth's lunch counter in Santa Fe.

VG/G. Sunned dust jacket.</p><p></p><h2>The War on Police: How the Ferguson Effect is Making America Unsafe</h2><p>The War on Police is a cop's-eye view of one of the most tumultuous times in recent history for law enforcement, which has spawned a growing movement, fueled by a biased news media and Black Lives Matter, to demonize police across the country. In the wake of the highly publicized shooting of Michael Brown after he robbed a store and attacked Officer Darren Wilson, the media and race-baiters immediately vilified the police. Even though the U.S. Justice Department, having reviewed 35,000 pages of records and forensic evidence and conducted hundreds of interviews, was forced to exonerate Officer Wilson, that meant nothing to angry protesters and the political and media elite. The Obama administration chose to &#x201c;let the embers of civil unrest burn, fanned by the rhetoric of opportunistic race dividers,&#x201d; says the president of the Law Enforcement Legal Defense Fund. Indeed, the battle lines had already been drawn and the attacks on police that followed Michael Brown&#x2019;s death and Officer Wilson&#x2019;s acquittal have since mushroomed into an all-out war. Complete with an exclusive one-on-one interview with Officer Darren Wilson, The War on Police starts by setting the record straight about the realities on the ground in Ferguson, repudiating the shameful movement against police. Author Jeff Roorda was law enforcement&#x2019;s most outspoken champion throughout the grueling ordeal in Missouri, offering a unique perspective on the impossible situation police departments nationwide encounter as they face-off against the media, politicians, protestors, and criminals. Roorda analyzes how, nearly two years later, the media perversely continue to slant story after story, attacking the methods police use to protect communities and themselves from criminals, despite the reality that before the Ferguson incident, crime had been declining for two decades. Yet after Ferguson and the war on police it ignited, violent crime has surged in cities across the country. The War on Police examines how fear of retaliation from politicians has seriously restricted police efforts to stop the thugs. Roorda looks at major cities across the country and shows how the bad guys &#x2013; who know the police are now afraid to show force &#x2013; are running rampant, leading to a sharp increase in thefts, shootings, and other crimes. The cops are alternately maligned for using too much force, and then for not stopping the violence. This dangerous war against the nation's police departments is making America increasingly unsafe and, ironically, turning our streets into war zones.</p><p><p><b>Jeff Roorda,</b> a retired police officer and a four-term Missouri State Representative, currently works as the business manager for the St. Louis Police Officers Association, the union that represents police in St. Louis, Missouri. Roorda is a monthly columnist for the <i> Gendarme</i>, the official newspaper of the St. Louis Police Officers Association. In the wake of the shooting of Michael Brown, Roorda was the go-to police commentator for CNN&#x2019;s coverage of the Ferguson incident and its aftermath, appearing on ABC, CNN, FOX and other news networks.</p>"If you want to be better informed about the debate &#x2014; no matter which side you&#x2019;re on &#x2014; read this book." &#x2014;&nbsp;<b>Harry Levins</b>, <i>St. Louis Post-Dispatch</i><br><br>"Jeff Roorda provides a captivating examination of what happened in Ferguson, why it happened and where we go from here. Smart, funny, candid and sincere, it's a must read for cops, police supporters, and anyone with an open mind. Mark out some time in your schedule for this book because once you pick it up, you won't be able to put it down." &#x2014;&nbsp;<b>Tom Jackson</b>, Retired Ferguson Police Chief&nbsp;<br><br>"<i>The War on Police</i>&nbsp;is a refreshingly honest look at the events of Ferguson but it doesn't stop there.

Grant&#39;s Heroic Last Year</h2><p>Shortly after losing all of his wealth in a terrible 1884 swindle, Ulysses S. Grant learned he had terminal throat and mouth cancer. Destitute and dying, Grant began to write his memoirs to save his family from permanent financial ruin.<p>As Grant continued his work, suffering increasing pain, the American public became aware of this race between Grant's writing and his fatal illness. Twenty years after his respectful and magnanimous demeanor toward Robert E. Lee at Appomattox, people in both the North and the South came to know Grant as the brave, honest man he was, now using his famous determination in this final effort. Grant finished <i>Memoirs</i> just four days before he died in July 1885.</p><p>Published after his death by his friend Mark Twain, Grant's <i>Memoirs</i> became an instant bestseller, restoring his family's financial health and, more importantly, helping to cure the nation of bitter discord. More than any other American before or since, Grant, in his last year, was able to heal this&#x2014;the country's greatest wound.</p></p><p><b>Charles Bracelen Flood</b> is the author of twelve previous books, including the bestselling <i>Lee: The Last Years</i> and <i>Grant and Sherman</i>, which Salon.com named one of the &#x201c;Top 12 Civil War Books Ever Written.&#x201d; He lives in Kentucky.<b><i>Minneapolis</i></b><b><i> Star-Tribune</i></b><b>, 1/15/12</b> &#x201c;Flood describes Grant's painful struggle to write as the tumors spread and ultimately took his life&#x2014;just three days after he completed the final page.

Levy surrounds readers with jokes, asides, and lively banter while presenting a chronological and systematic account of the evolution of prehistoric life from 250 million to 6 million years ago. A glib cockroach guides readers through a clear explanation of the split of the continent Pangaea, of the development of dinosaurs from the diminutive size of a chicken to that of a six-story building, and of the extinction of prehistoric creatures. Then, starting 65 million years ago, the author explains how the atmosphere and sun began to influence a change in North America, making it a rain forest. In this environment, mammalian life evolved and the continents continued to move. Levy explains why the rain forests receded and the woolly mammoth and nine other mammals flourished during this cold period, the ice age. The last section describes evolution of humans to 6000 years ago when the larger ice-age mammals became extinct. Wound around these explanations are slapstick line drawings that are on an even par with continual wisecracks in the text. This overview will satiate the high interest many young people have about prehistoric times and will appeal to reluctant readers.<br><i>Nancy Call, Santa Cruz Public Libraries, Aptos, CA </i><br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Seawitch</h2><p><p>The tale of murder and revenge set on a remote oil rig, from the acclaimed master of action and suspense.</p><p>SEAWITCH</p><p>The massive oil-rig is the hub of a great empire, the pride of its billionaire owner.</p><p>Lord Worth, predatory and ruthless, has clawed his way to great wealth.

The message is clear: Ostrich finds "his voice at last, / his own beauty, / his big, terrific self." However, there is no precipitating reason for this change.

She lives in Texas. <b>www.kathiappelt.com</b>Ages 6-8. This appealing concept book should find a welcome home in classrooms studying prepositions. The text is limited almost exclusively to the prepositions themselves, as the lush, textured acrylic illustrations follow the hot-air balloon journey of two young elephants. Invited to Africa to visit their aunt, Rama, Raja, and a prodigious load of luggage pile "in" the balloon's basket, soar "above" and "beside" domes and minarets, "through" the clouds, "behind" a waterfall, "across" the ocean, until they reach their destination and run "into" the arms of Auntie Rwanda. Readers will easily supply the object to each printed preposition, and even pre-readers will often be able to identify the preposition from the broad visual clues. Although the journey is fanciful, Baker has distinguished Asian and African settings through architectural and environmental details and has differentiated Asian and African elephants by ear shape. A tendency for important figures to fall into the seam is occasionally distracting, but not a major problem in a book whose large size makes this useful for classroom presentations. <i>Elizabeth Bush</i></p><h2>Vicious: The Faces of Evil Series: Book 7</h2><p><strong>Book 7 in the Faces of Evil series.</strong><br>Serial killer Eric Spears is far from done.

The TV in the corner was playing a familiar song. It was the opening to a ghost-chasing reality show called Ghost Jumpers. Erin gave a sarcastic snort as the show&#x2019;s intense yet cheery host walked down the dark hallway of an abandoned mental ward.<br> <br>&#x201c;Who you gonna call? Ghost Jumpers!&#x201d; The host introduced the program, adding, &#x201c;Tonight on Ghost Jumpers we are locking ourselves into this abandoned mental ward for seven days straight, only allowing ourselves out to eat, sleep, and run general errands&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>Erin straightened her skirt and blouse. She checked her hair in the mirror. Once she determined that she looked respectable, she made a face at the TV.<br> <br>&#x201c;Uch. So stupid,&#x201d; Erin said, turning it off.<br> <br>She opened her closet where several similar-looking plaid blazers hung in a neat row. She chose one and put it on, glancing in the mirror one last time. Yes. Respectable.<br> <br>Erin grabbed her messenger bag and left the apartment.<br> <br><br> <br>On the front lawn of the Columbia University campus, students sat outside debating what they&#x2019;d learned. Erin walked proudly through the school, nodding at a few colleagues as she passed by. She was happy. This was her dream job.<br> <br>Inside Alumni Hall, members of the academic elite milled about in conversation. Erin ran a hand over the dark polished wood. She belonged here. She was respected here.<br> <br>Her boyfriend, Phil Hudson, saw her come in. &#x201c;Erin. Sweetheart,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>There was an awkward miscommunication&#x2014;was Phil was going to kiss her on the lips or cheek?&#x2014;but Erin was used to awkward. She brushed off the incident and allowed him to lead her across the faculty lounge.<br> <br>&#x201c;Did you hear?&#x201d; Erin asked Phil. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m lecturing in the big hall today.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Darling, that&#x2019;s wonderful.&#x201d; He took in her shirt, blouse, and jacket. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s what you&#x2019;re wearing?&#x201d;<br> <br>Erin felt a little rattled by his question. &#x201c;What? Why?&#x201d;<br> <br>Phil shook it off. &#x201c;No, you look fine. I have someone I want you to meet.&#x201d; A stuffy looking woman didn&#x2019;t smile as they approached.<br> <br>&#x201c;Phyllis Adler, I&#x2019;d like to introduce you to Erin Gilbert. She specializes in theoretical particle physics.&#x201d; Phil stood between the two women. He told Erin, &#x201c;Phyllis is guest lecturing in Daniel&#x2019;s Astrophysics and Cosmology today.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m a huge fan of your work,&#x201d; Erin said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s such an honor.&#x201d;<br> <br>Phil told Phyllis, &#x201c;Erin just learned she&#x2019;s being published in Nature.&#x201d;<br> <br>Erin beamed. &#x201c;Yes, I am very proud.&#x201d;<br> <br>Phyllis, however, shook her head. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t allow my lab to submit to journals anymore. I think that journals tamper with the process and ultimately hurt scientific research.&#x201d;<br> <br>Erin struggled with how to respond. &#x201c;Yes, that&#x2019;s true,&#x201d; she said, no longer smiling. &#x201c;I was conflicted about the whole thing.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It becomes more about the splash than good science,&#x201d; Phyllis replied. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re completely self-serving, and the effects on science are nocuous.&#x201d;<br> <br>Erin said, &#x201c;I see what you&#x2019;re saying. It&#x2019;s like when scientists get caught up in winning some dumb award&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>Phyllis dismissed her, saying, &#x201c;Oh, awards are massively important.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Absolutely. Absolutely.&#x201d; Erin nodded like a bobble-head.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s unfortunately the only way you can draw attention to good science,&#x201d; Phyllis said.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s an excellent point.&#x201d; Erin checked her watch. &#x201c;Well, I better get going. Lecturing in the big hall today. Give my ideas room to really spread their wings.&#x201d; She laughed, but Phyllis remained stone-faced.<br> <br>When Erin turned to say good-bye to Phil, it was another awkward miscommunication and instead of kissing his cheek, she kissed his shoulder.<br> <br>&#x201c;Good luck on your tenure review!&#x201d; Phil said, not seeming to notice the not-quite-a-second-kiss incident.<br> <br>&#x201c;Thank you. Fingers crossed,&#x201d; Erin said. &#x201c;Not that there&#x2019;s anything to crossing your fingers, of course.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t disagree more,&#x201d; Phyllis said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s been proven that superstitions can have a tremendous performance benefit.&#x201d;<br> <br>Erin sighed. &#x201c;Exactly.&#x201d;<br> <br><br> <br>After a quick walk across campus, Erin took her place at the front of a large modern lecture hall.<br> <br>An older man entered the room and stopped behind her.<br> <br>&#x201c;Aahhh!&#x201d; Erin screamed when she discovered him there. Trying to regain composure, she picked up a file as if she&#x2019;d been reading it all along. &#x201c;Yes?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry for interrupting,&#x201d; the man said. He introduced himself as Ed Mulgrave. &#x201c;I need to speak with you about something you wrote.&#x201d;<br> <br>Erin began to pack up her things. &#x201c;All right. Which publication?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m talking about your book,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>Erin froze for a second, then played it off. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure what you mean.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re Erin Gilbert?&#x201d; He held up a thick tome and read the title. &#x201c;Co-author of Ghosts from Our Past: Both Literally and Figuratively: The Study of the Paranormal.&#x201d;<br> <br>Erin continued to pack up. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, that must be a different Erin Gilbert.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ed squinted at the photo inside the flap. &#x201c;This really does look like you&#x2014;&#x201d; He turned the book toward her, then raised it next to her face.<br> <br>Erin batted his hand away. &#x201c;Listen, Mr. Mulgrave. That book was just sort of a joke. No self-respecting scientist really believes in the paranormal. That was a long time ago, just a gag between two friends.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ed weighed the book in his hands. &#x201c;A four-hundred-and-sixty-page gag?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What do you want?&#x201d; Erin gave up.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m the historian at the Aldridge Museum, and I believe it&#x2019;s haunted,&#x201d; Ed told her.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you give ghost tours? Isn&#x2019;t that the whole point?&#x201d; Erin slipped her bag over her shoulder for a quick getaway.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, but that&#x2019;s just for fun. And ticket sales,&#x201d; he admitted. &#x201c;But this has never happened before. It scared my tour guide nearly to death. Can you just take a look? I tried the police, but I sound crazy.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, but that book you&#x2019;re holding is nonsense,&#x201d; Erin replied. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know how you found it anyway. I thought I burned both copies.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, I bought it online,&#x201d; Ed told her. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s on Amazon. Both hard copy and e-book.&#x201d;<br> <br>Erin&#x2019;s eyes registered both shock and rage as she took in that information. She tried to hide her feelings. Very slowly she said, &#x201c;Is it now?&#x201d;<br> <br><br> <br>The instant she was alone, Erin booted up the computer in her office. She clicked on the book link.<br> <br>&#x201c;NO!&#x201d;<br> <br>It was on Amazon.com. Underneath the title were two names: hers, and the other author&#x2019;s, Abigail L. Yates. A big picture of Erin filled the screen with the words &#x201c;Ghosts are Real!&#x201d; above her head in huge letters.<br> <br>Erin would have exploded in anger if there hadn&#x2019;t been a knock at the door. It was the head of her department, Harold Filmore, coming into the small room.<br> <br>&#x201c;Erin&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; She quickly rotated the monitor away from him. &#x201c;Yes. How is your day faring?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Erin . . .&#x201d; Filmore was always serious. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re set for the final review of your tenure case on Thursday, but I saw that you had a recommendation letter from Dr. Brennen at Princeton.&#x201d; He looked appalled. &#x201c;Their science department just isn&#x2019;t what it used to be. I&#x2019;d consider getting a referral from a more prestigious school.&#x201d;<br> <br>Erin furrowed her brow. &#x201c;More prestigious than Princ&#x2014;?&#x201d; She stopped herself from arguing. &#x201c;Yes, of course. I can&#x2019;t believe I almost did that.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I think you are an asset to modern physics and I&#x2019;d hate to see you throw it down the drain.&#x201d; Filmore turned to leave, taking a last look at Erin before he exited. &#x201c;Oh, and about your clothes.&#x201d;<br> <br>Erin sighed. &#x201c;Um . . . what about them?&#x201d;<br> <br>He stared at her for a moment, then said, &#x201c;Never mind.&#x201d;<br> <br>The instant he was gone, she turned back to the computer. &#x201c;Abigail L. Yates,&#x201d; Erin read aloud, glancing at the biography. &#x201c;?&#x2018;Abigail continues her passion for the study of paranormal at the Kenneth P. Higgins Institute of Science.&#x2019;?&#x201d; She grunted. &#x201c;Ooof.&#x201d;</p><h2>Rags of Glory</h2><p>Rags of Glory [Hardcover]</p><p></p><h2>Naoki Urasawa&#39;s Monster, Vol. 4</h2><p>Brilliant doctor Kenzo Tenma risks his reputation and promising career to save the life of a critically wounded young boy.

His grandfather&#x2014;my great-grandfather John Hawking&#x2014;had been a wealthy farmer, but he had bought too many farms and had gone bankrupt in the agricultural depression at the beginning of this century. His son Robert&#x2014;my grandfather&#x2014;tried to help his father but went bankrupt himself. Fortunately, Robert&#x2019;s wife owned a house in Boroughbridge in which she ran a school, and this brought in a small amount of income. They thus managed to send their son to Oxford, where he studied medicine.<br><br>My father won a series of scholarships and prizes, which enabled him to send money back to his parents. He then went into research in tropical medicine, and in 1937 he traveled to East Africa as part of his research. When the war began, he made an overland journey across Africa and down the Congo River to get a ship back to England, where he volunteered for military service. He was told, however, that he was more valuable in medical research.<br><br>My mother was born in Dunfermline, Scotland, the third of eight children of a family doctor. The eldest was a girl with Down syndrome, who lived separately with a caregiver until she died at the age of thirteen. The family moved south to Devon when my mother was twelve. Like my father&#x2019;s family, hers was not well off. Nevertheless, they too managed to send my mother to Oxford. After Oxford, she had various jobs, including that of inspector of taxes, which she did not like. She gave that up to become a secretary, which was how she met my father in the early years of the war.<br><br>I was born on January 8, 1942, exactly three hundred years after the death of Galileo. I estimate, however, that about two hundred thousand other babies were also born that day. I don&#x2019;t know whether any of them was later interested in astronomy.<br><br>I was born in Oxford, even though my parents were living in London. This was because during World War II, the Germans had an agreement that they would not bomb Oxford and Cambridge, in return for the British not bombing Heidelberg and G�ttingen. It is a pity that this civilized sort of arrangement couldn&#x2019;t have been extended to more cities.<br><br>We lived in Highgate, in north London. My sister Mary was born eighteen months after me, and I&#x2019;m told I did not welcome her arrival. All through our childhood there was a certain tension between us, fed by the narrow difference in our ages. In our adult life, however, this tension has disappeared, as we have gone different ways. She became a doctor, which pleased my father.<br><br>My sister Philippa was born when I was nearly five and better able to understand what was happening. I can remember looking forward to her arrival so that there would be three of us to play games. She was a very intense and perceptive child, and I always respected her judgment and opinions. My brother, Edward, was adopted much later, when I was fourteen, so he hardly entered my childhood at all. He was very different from the other three children, being completely non-academic and non-intellectual, which was probably good for us. He was a rather difficult child, but one couldn&#x2019;t help liking him. He died in 2004 from a cause that was never properly determined; the most likely explanation is that he was poisoned by fumes from the glue he was using for renovations in his flat.<br><br>My earliest memory is of standing in the nursery of Byron House School in Highgate and crying my head off. All around me, children were playing with what seemed like wonderful toys, and I wanted to join in. But I was only two and a half, this was the first time I had been left with people I didn&#x2019;t know, and I was scared. I think my parents were rather surprised at my reaction, because I was their first child and they had been following child development textbooks that said that children ought to be ready to start making social relationships at two. But they took me away after that awful morning and didn&#x2019;t send me back to Byron House for another year and a half.<br><br>At that time, during and just after the war, Highgate was an area in which a number of scientific and academic people lived. (In another country they would have been called intellectuals, but the English have never admitted to having any intellectuals.) All these parents sent their children to Byron House School, which was a very progressive school for those times.<br><br>I remember complaining to my parents that the school wasn&#x2019;t teaching me anything. The educators at Byron House didn&#x2019;t believe in what was then the accepted way of drilling things into you. Instead, you were supposed to learn to read without realizing you were being taught. In the end, I did learn to read, but not until the fairly late age of eight. My sister Philippa was taught to read by more conventional methods and could read by the age of four. But then, she was definitely brighter than me.<br><br>We lived in a tall, narrow Victorian house, which my parents had bought very cheaply during the war, when everyone thought London was going to be bombed flat. In fact, a V-2 rocket landed a few houses away from ours. I was away with my mother and sister at the time, but my father was in the house. Fortunately, he was not hurt, and the house was not badly damaged. But for years there was a large bomb site down the road, on which I used to play with my friend Howard, who lived three doors the other way. Howard was a revelation to me because his parents weren&#x2019;t intellectuals like the parents of all the other children I knew. He went to the council school, not Byron House, and he knew about football and boxing, sports that my parents wouldn&#x2019;t have dreamed of following.<br><br>Another early memory was getting my first train set. Toys were not manufactured during the war, at least not for the home market. But I had a passionate interest in model trains. My father tried making me a wooden train, but that didn&#x2019;t satisfy me, as I wanted something that moved on its own. So he got a secondhand clockwork train, repaired it with a soldering iron, and gave it to me for Christmas when I was nearly three. That train didn&#x2019;t work very well. But my father went to America just after the war, and when he came back on the Queen Mary he brought my mother some nylons, which were not obtainable in Britain at that time. He brought my sister Mary a doll that closed its eyes when you laid it down. And he brought me an American train, complete with a cowcatcher and a figure-eight track. I can still remember my excitement as I opened the box.<br><br>Clockwork trains, which you had to wind up, were all very well, but what I really wanted were electric trains. I used to spend hours watching a model railway club layout in Crouch End, near Highgate. I dreamed about electric trains. Finally, when both my parents were away somewhere, I took the opportunity to draw out of the Post Office bank all of the very modest amount of money that people had given me on special occasions such as my christening. I used the money to buy an electric train set, but frustratingly enough, it didn&#x2019;t work very well either. I should have taken the set back and demanded that the shop or manufacturer replace it, but in those days the attitude was that it was a privilege to buy something, and it was just your bad luck if it turned out to be faulty. So I paid for the electric motor of the engine to be serviced, but it never worked very well, even then.<br><br>Later on, in my teens, I built model airplanes and boats. I was never very good with my hands, but I did this with my school friend John McClenahan, who was much better and whose father had a workshop in their house. My aim was always to build working models that I could control. I didn&#x2019;t care what they looked like. I think it was the same drive that led me to invent a series of very complicated games with another school friend, Roger Ferneyhough. There was a manufacturing game, complete with factories in which units of different colors were made, roads and railways on which they were carried, and a stock market. There was a war game, played on a board of four thousand squares, and even a feudal game, in which each player was a whole dynasty, with a family tree. I think these games, as well as the trains, boats, and airplanes, came from an urge to know how systems worked and how to control them. Since I began my PhD, this need has been met by my research into cosmology. If you understand how the universe operates, you control it, in a way.</p><h2>The 101st Airborne at Normandy</h2><p>Describes the experiences of the members of the airborne division assigned to parachute behind the German lines the night before D-Day</p><p></p><h2>Studies in Religious Iconography: Religious Art in France, Volume 2: The Thirteenth Century: A Study of Medieval Iconography and Its Sources (Bollingen Series, 101)</h2><p><p>This is the second of three volumes of a classic series on French religious art, the monumental accomplishment of the eminent French scholar Emile M�le (1862-1954).

However, because our society on the whole discounts our grief as frivolous since we&#x2019;ve "merely lost an animal," too many of us feel we must keep silent in our anguish or be labeled somehow defective. Good Grief: Finding Peace After Pet Loss ends the misperception that we must suffer in solitary confinement and thus prolong, or stay permanently stuck in, our grief. The book melds the author&#x2019;s personal perspectives, as both a pet lover and animal chaplain, and astounding stories with those of professionals (such as veterinarians, animal communicators, and religious leaders) and other animal lovers the world over to help you make the pet-grieving process as positive as possible.</p><p>Who thinks you're the most wonderful, irreplaceable being in existence (even when you're cranky, have bed head, have put on some pounds, etc.)? Who forgives you virtually anything, never holds a grudge, and loves you unconditionally? The answer to all of the above is our animal companions. With them we share an intense emotional bond. So why is it that, when grieving their passing, many of us still feel we must suffer in silence or be labeled somehow defective? Good Grief: Finding Peace After Pet Loss shows you how to: � How to emotionally prepare for a pet&#x2019;s euthanasia&#x2014;understanding when it&#x2019;s time; � How to take care of yourself while around people who just don&#x2019;t understand your pain; � How to view death not as an ending, but (as animals see it) a natural transformation; � How to memorialize and celebrate your pet&#x2019;s life; and � How to move on after your loss and love again. Endorsements: "Fellow creatures can teach us how to love, and when they move on they leave a great hole that this book will help to fill." Dr. Michael W. Fox, author and syndicated Animal Doctor columnist and "The animals in our lives already have the knowing that the end of their life is another transition, and all the love that is exchanged between us lives on forever. This book has great testimonies to try to help pet lovers cope with the deep loss of their beloved companions." Lydia Hiby, animal communicatorSid Korpi has combined her decades of varied professional experience&#x2014;as an editor, writer, journalist, English teacher, actor, ordained minister/animal chaplain and member of the Association of Pet Loss and Bereavement&#x2014;with her lifelong devotion to the animal companions who have blessed and shared her life in creating Good Grief: Finding Peace After Pet Loss. Surviving a &#x201c;tsunami of loss&#x201d; in her own life led to her discovery of spiritual truths that brought her strength and facilitated her heart&#x2019;s healing. She felt compelled to share these things with others who suffer&#x2014;often in isolation&#x2014;from the passing on of their very dearest nonhuman friends, their pets.

Of Permanent Value hits bookshelves as the most comprehensive, informative biography yet on the investor who, through knowledge, savvy, and hard work, became the world&#39;s second-richest man. Avid investors will even find a chapter detailing Buffett&#39;s unprecedented investment record, quarter by quarter.Filled with fascinating strategies, compelling stories, and rare photos. Of Permanent Value delivers a hard-hitting but highly readable story of how Buffett built his empire -- and what he plans to do next. It gives investors and Wall Street enthusiasts at every level: -- Behind-the-scenes stories of Buffett&#39;s remarkable rise-- Personal details of Buffett&#39;s best investment moves-- A candid examination of history&#39;s most successful investor</p><p><p>At age six Warren Buffett paid a quarter for a six pack of Cokes and sold each Coke for a nickel-a return of 20%. From then on he compounded his returns at better than 20%. That's why he's a multi-billionaire-indeed the second richest person in the world.. </p><p>Today Buffett's investment vehicle, Berkshire Hathaway, is a major shareholder in some of the greatest companies on earth: Coca-Cola, Gillette, Disney, American Express, a brand name extravaganza. GEICO, Berkshire's auto insurance unit, and Berkshire's other insurance entities, make up one of Buffett's secret weapons. They provide about $7 billion of "float," or other peoples money. Berkshire receives the money in the form of premiums and invests it, multiplying it profitably until time to pay off insurance claims. Berkshire, often thought of as a batch of stocks worth about $40 billion, is far more. The stock portfolio Is one of its three legs. The second leg is the enormous insurance business. A third leg is a collection of wholly owned businesses. With the purchase of the rest of GEICO in early 1996, the buyout of FlightSafety International in late 1996 and the smaller purchases of Star Furniture in 1997 and International Dairy Queen in 1998, Berkshire is now a constellation of operating businesses. The enormous stock portfolio, the insurance businesses and the operating businesses all do one thing-throw off a ton of cash for new investments. None of this counts the 129.7 million ounces of silver, some oil and fixed-income portfolio worth north of $10 billion. And none of this includes Berkshire's newest amazing deal-the $22 billion purchase of General Re Corp. Although it is Buffett's genius and personality which holds Berkshire together, he has had help from an extraordinary group of people. First and foremost is Charles Munger who has offered advice for almost 40 years and has pulled Buffett away from investing in lesser quality stocks. Munger has helped Buffett see the advantages of brand name companies with consumer franchises, pricing power and durability. Buffett and Munger-in Buffett's words-became "mental partners" back in 1959. Munger jokes that he deserves credit for hooking up with Buffett in the early days when Buffett had no outward appearances of success. "He had a crew cut. He was working out of a sun porch at his house and his dietary [leanings] were toward Pepsi, salted nuts and no vegetables." Munger, Lou Simpson and Ajit Jain within Berkshire have aided Buffett as have a number of figures outside Berkshire, including Tom Murphy, Katharine Graham and Bill Ruane.</p>A fascinating journey inside the world--and mind--of Warren Buffett. Warren Buffett is history&#39;s greatest investor--and America&#39;s third-richest man. But how did Buffet reach that pinnacle? What did he see that others missed? And perhaps most important...What does he see today? Of Permanent Value takes us where no other book has, making us privy to Warren Buffett&#39;s successes, his secrets to investing, and his plans for the future. From earning pennies selling Coca-Cola in his youth to buying a major stake in the soft drink giant as an adult, Warren Buffet has always followed his own path. Of Permanent Value offers a uniquely candid overview of that path, including: how Buffett turned a 1956 investment of $10,000 into $250 million today--after taxes!; step-by-step replays of Buffett&#39;s best investment moves--and some he&#39;d just as soon forget; extensive interviews with Buffett&#39;s family, friends, and business associates that reveal his thoughts and investments philosophies. Filled with fascinating facts, rare photographs, and compelling stories from some of the world&#39;s leading public figures--all told in nugget-sized chapters that are fascinating to read and impossible to put down--Of Permanent Value is the story of Warren Buffet himself. It is an intrinsically American tale, one to which we can all relate...and from which we can all profit. So pull up a set and have a few words with the &#34;Oracle of Omaha&#34;--one of the great financial minds of all time.</p><h2>Infinite Variety: The Life and Legend of the Marchesa Casati (Definitive Edition)</h2><p>For the first three decades of the twentieth century, the Marchesa Casati astounded Europe: nude servants gilded in gold leaf attended her; bizarre wax mannequins sat as guests at her dining table; and she was infamous for her evening strolls, naked beneath her furs, parading cheetahs on diamond-studded leashes. Artists painted, sculpted, and photographed her; poets praised her strange beauty.

Now, some of those very reformers, including Tom DeLay and Jack Abramoff, are under investigation, their careers and reputations tarnished by the very system they helped to create.<br> <br>The story begins in 1994, when a landslide victory led to the first GOP-controlled Congress in forty years. The Republicans had it all: a visionary leader in Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, a program for reform in the Contract With America, and a bonafide electoral mandate. They pledged to shrink government, reform politics, and drain the swamp of public malfeasance. Ten years later the Republican party finds itself embroiled in crippling scandals that have already brought about the fall of House majority leader DeLay and may reach all the way into the White House. <br><br>In <i>The K Street Gang</i>, you'll meet DeLay, the brazen ideologue and prodigious fundraiser who invited lobbyists to run amok in exchange for campaign contributions; Jack Abramoff, the conservative activist who left a troubled career in Hollywood for a new beginning as a Washington lobbyist, only to fleece his clients out of millions of dollars; Ralph Reed, the former executive director of the Christian Coalition whose principles took a backseat to his business interests; Grover Norquist, the fiery antitax activist who provided intellectual ammunition for the Republican takeover of the lobbying industry, only to see the lobbyists take over his party; and Adam Kidan, a down-on-his-luck Republican businessman who engineered the scam of a lifetime-one that had deadly consequences.<br><br>You'll learn how Grover Norquist helped arranged meetings between George W. Bush and men who are now alleged to be Islamic terrorists; how a former lifeguard rose from beachbum to aide to one of Washington's most powerful congressmen to high-powered and extremely wealthy lobbyist, and how he lost it all; and how a routine audit of an obscure Indian tribe's finances has led to a widespread public corruption investigation that threatens the political futures of half a dozen congressmen and the political future of the Republican Party.<br><br>In <i>The K Street Gang</i>, Matthew Continetti takes us behind the headlines to meet a group of young idealists who came to Washington to do good and ended up staying to do well.

Michel was eighty years old. He was first elected to Congress in 1956. His face was streaked with wrinkles, he wore thick glasses with lenses the size of car windshields, and he had little hair. He looked like a relic. <br><br>In a way, he <i>was </i>a relic. Michel&#x2019;s career almost perfectly traced the decline of the Republican congressional majority. By the time Michel retired from Congress, the last year Republicans had controlled the House of Representatives was in 1954. That was two years before he had been first elected to represent Illinois&#x2019;s 18th District. Michel had come to Congress just when his party was on the way down. <br><br>Yet, as the party declined, Michel rose through the ranks. He became minority whip in 1975, and minority leader in 1981. In both jobs he shepherded Republican legislation through the House as best he could. He was often referred to as an &#x201c;institutionalist&#x201d;&#x2013; someone who exploited the rules and regulations of the House for tactical gain. But more often than not conservatives referred to him as an &#x201c;accommodationist&#x201d;&#x2013;someone with no sense of overall strategy who was all too eager to make deals with the House Democratic leadership. <br><br>Michel was soft, conservatives grumbled. He was afraid to take a stand against the Democrats, who, after decades in power, had grown decadent and corrupt. And Michel knew, too, that the younger a Republican House member was, the more he was itching for a fight with the opposition. As Republican representation in the House had shrunk, it had also become more conservative&#x2013;far more conservative than Michel. At the press conference announcing his retirement Michel admitted he was &#x201c;much more comfortable&#x201d; in the Washington that existed &#x201c;when I first came to Congress.&#x201d;(1)<br> <br>One of Michel&#x2019;s harshest critics&#x2013;and the frontrunner to replace him&#x2013;was Newt Gingrich, who had represented Georgia&#x2019;s 11th District since 1979, and who had been elected minority whip in 1989, after Dick Cheney left that post to serve as President George H.W. Bush&#x2019;s secretary of defense. Gingrich was Michel&#x2019;s opposite in almost every way. He was fiercely ideological, tirelessly combat�ive, and endlessly inventive. Before he entered electoral politics, Gingrich had been a history professor, and so his mind, he said, was attuned to the faint vibrations that signaled the rise, decline, and renascence of civilizations. <br>Also, unlike Michel, whose midwestern Republicanism had its roots in 1950s budget-cutting and isolationism, Gingrich was a true Reaganite. He was a supply-sider who thought that lower marginal tax rates would spur economic growth and increase tax revenues. He believed in American power, a strong national defense, and standing up to the tyrannical Soviet Union. And though his conser�vatism was not religious, he was nonetheless a cultural warrior, and thought that a libertine Boomer elite, reared in the student revolts of the 1960s, governed the country from the coasts in an increas�ingly out-of-touch manner. <br><br>Gingrich was also famous. His political celebrity had been grow�ing for some time. He had first gained prominence in the early 1980s, when he used after-hours &#x201c;special orders&#x201d; speeches, broadcast live on the C-SPAN television network, to harangue the House Democratic leadership. He led ethics crusades against Democratic Speakers Tom Foley and Jim Wright. He argued that the Democratic Congress was plagued by scandal&#x2013;scandals at the House bank, scandals at the House post office, scandals at the highest reaches of congressional power&#x2013;and that only a thoroughgoing purge would set things right. He tried to combine the wisdom of a public intellectual with the guile of a public official. A simple conversation with Gingrich would be inevitably laced with references to Napoleon, science fiction, Churchill, the futurist authors Alvin and Heidi Toffler, Franklin Roo�sevelt, and Peter Drucker. He preached a transformative politics that would break the old systems of the past and help move America for�ward into the Information Age. Gingrich was the first example of the paradoxical species that would eventually proliferate throughout Washington: the progressive conservative. <br><br>He was an ideologue. But Gingrich could also be incredibly charming, at least to Washington conservatives, who swooned whenever the minority whip gave a speech about rescuing American civilization from liberal elites, unleashing the dynamism of the American economy through tax cuts and deregulation, and chang�ing the culture of Washington so that power rested with the Ameri�can people, not special interests. And all of Gingrich&#x2019;s speeches and articles, delivered at conservative think tanks and retreats and reprinted in the pages of the small conservative magazines, had one thing in common: They would usually end with assurances that one day, perhaps sooner than people thought, there would be a congres�sional Republican majority. <br><br>But this would not happen, Gingrich argued, as long as someone like Bob Michel ran the House Republican caucus. It came as no surprise, then, that within hours of Michel&#x2019;s announcement on October 4, 1993, Gingrich had, in turn, announced his candidacy for minority leader. It was no contest. As minority whip, Gingrich had already rallied a majority of the conference to vote for him&#x2013; more than a year before the Republicans would hold leadership elections in December 1994. Michel allies were left in the dark. A new power was rising in the Republican party, one that was uncom�promising, loud, and visionary. <br>The problem was, the <i>actual</i> rising power wasn&#x2019;t Gingrich. In fact, Gingrich&#x2019;s rise was so stunning, his personality so polarizing, his visage so ubiquitous, that his quick elevation to minority-leader-in-waiting obscured another fissure in the House Republican lead�ership. That fissure was opened by the race to replace Gingrich as minority whip. And the man who won that race, which began the same day Gingrich locked up the post of minority leader, was ulti�mately to have more power on Capitol Hill than Newt Gingrich ever dreamed of having. <br><br>It is in the nature of revolutions that they consume their most passionate advocates. The vanguard&#x2019;s ideals are replaced by the fac-tion&#x2019;s brass knuckles. The chain of events that Robespierre set in motion led to his death by guillotine in 1794. Trotsky fled from Stalin and met his fate with an ice pick to the head in Mexico in 1940. The dynamics of political revolutions in a constitutional republic such as the United States are nonviolent, but the parallels between political insurgencies remain. One group comes to power pledging reform; the reformers&#x2019; newfound power attracts a troop of opportunists and hangers-on; the opportunists eat away at the reformist impulse from within. Newt Gingrich&#x2019;s Republican Revo�lution would turn out to be no different. <br><br>Three candidates ran to replace Gingrich as minority whip, yet only two really mattered. (Florida representative Bill McCollum always trailed the others.) In one corner was Gingrich&#x2019;s longtime ally Robert Walker, the fifty-one-year-old congressman from Penn-sylvania&#x2019;s 16th District. Walker had been Gingrich&#x2019;s chief deputy whip&#x2013;responsible for &#x201c;whipping up&#x201d; support on key votes&#x2013;since 1989. He had the requisite experience, and he was committed to Gingrich&#x2019;s ideals and programs. His association with Gingrich began long before he joined the whip team. With Gingrich and Minnesota Republican Vin Weber, Walker had cofounded the Con�servative Opportunity Society in the early 1980s, a sort of in-house think tank that sought to tilt the Republican caucus to the right. <br><br>With Gingrich, too, Walker had pioneered the use of after-hours speeches on C-SPAN. In Walker&#x2019;s case, however, this sometimes proved to be embarrassing: Once, as he delivered a televised special orders speech, House Speaker Tip O&#x2019;Neill ordered the C-SPAN cameras to pull back&#x2013;revealing that Walker was speaking to an empty chamber. But such embarrassment did little to hurt his relationship with Gingrich, who had often said that Walker was his &#x201c;closest personal friend in the House.&#x201d;(2) Loyalty mattered, after all. <br><br>In the other corner was Tom DeLay, the forty-seven-year-old rep�resentative from Texas&#x2019;s 22nd Congressional District. DeLay was an experienced politician and a hard-core conservative. It was his fury at Texas&#x2019;s environmental regulations that led him to run for the state legislature in 1978. It was his distress at the burdens the Federal government placed on business&#x2013;more regulation, heavy payroll taxes, an intrusive Internal Revenue Service&#x2013;that sparked his run for Congress in 1984. Caught in the Reagan whirlwind, DeLay came to Washington at a time when free enterprise, not gov�ernment, was sexy. Clearly DeLay would sympathize with business interests. He was one himself. <br><br>In December 1992, DeLay had been elected secretary of the Republican Conference. In a House filled with scalawags, layabouts, and diehards, DeLay was unusual in that he combined the convic�tions of an ideological conservative with the street smarts of a machine politician. When DeLay first arrived in Washington, he had quickly aligned himself with Bob Michel. The move made sense at the time&#x2013;above all, DeLay wanted to be close to power&#x2013;but within a few years it became clear that it was damaging his career. <br><br>This was because DeLay had made allies with the old guard. He had sided with pols who were on their way...</p><h2>Undue Influence: The Epic Battle for the Johnson &amp; Johnson Fortune</h2><p>An account of the battle over the Johnson &amp; Johnson fortune describes how Basia Johnson, the Polish servant who married the elderly Johnson &amp; Johnson heir when she was just thirty-two, battled with the Johnson family for the estate. 100,000 first printing. $125,000 ad/promo.</p><p>The "largest, costliest, ugliest, most spectacular and most conspicuous" inheritance contest in American history here receives thorough, incisive and dramatic treatment from New York Times legal affairs correspondent Margolick. In 1971, 76-year-old J. Seward Johnson, heir to the Johnson &amp; Johnson fortune, married his 34-year-old Polish household servant; when he died 12 years later, his six adult offspring sued to stop the widow, Basia, from inheriting most of the half-billion-dollar estate. While Margolick ably conveys Basia's imperiousness and the children's dissolution, the book shines in its sophisticated analysis of the prominent attorneys and New York City law firms representing the various parties, and in its scathing portrait of tough, profane and peremptory Judge Marie Lambert. After a bizarre 17-week trial in 1986, the two sides settled, with Basia paying out approximately $43 million to the Johnson children. Both parties claimed victory, but Margolick's anatomy of the process shows everyone's claims to be tainted. This is a far meatier and more critical look at the case than Barbara Goldsmith's 1987 Johnson v. Johnson. Photos not seen by PW. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.At the age of 76, Seward Johnson, the Johnson &amp; Johnson magnate, married Barbara Piasecka, a recent Polish immigrant 42 years his junior. When he died 12 years later, she inherited his $400 million fortune after a protracted and scandalous legal battle with her six stepchildren. This book tells the story of the contesting of that will and the eccentricities of the litigants, the lawyers, and the judge. Margolick's strength is also his weakness; even the most legal-minded reader may become impatient with the wealth of detail in his 600-page account. Because no sources whatsoever are provided, the reader is left still more frustrated.

He lives in Philadelphia.</p></p><h2>Sphere</h2><p>This suspense thriller opens as a 300 year old spaceship is discovered on the South Pacific Ocean floor.</p><p><i>Jurassic Park</i> author Michael Crichton is possibly the best science teacher for the masses since H.G. Wells, and <i>Sphere</i>, his thriller about a mysterious spherical spaceship at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean, is classic Crichton. A group of not-very-complex characters (portrayed in the film by Sharon Stone, Dustin Hoffman, Samuel L. Jackson, and Queen Latifah) assemble to solve a cleverly designed roller coaster of a mystery while attempting (with mixed success) to avoid sudden death and expounding (much more successfully) on the latest, coolest scientific ideas, including the existence of black holes. Somehow, Crichton manages to convey the complicated stuff in utterly simplistic prose, making him, as his old pal Steven Spielberg puts it, "the high priest of high concept." Yet there is more to Crichton than science and big-ticket show biz. He is also, as any reader of his startling memoir <i>Travels</i> knows, a bit of a mystic--he is entirely open to notions spouted by spoon-bending psychics that most science writers would scorn. <i>Sphere</i> is not only a gratifying sci-fi suspense tale; it also reflects Crichton's keen interest in the unexplained powers of the human mind. When something passes through a black hole in Crichton's fiction, a lesson is learned. The book also contains another profound lesson: when you're staring down a giant squid with an eyeball the size of a dinner plate, don't blink first.<p>&#x201c;Crichton keeps us guessing at every turn in his best work since The Andromeda Strain.&#x201d;&#x2014;<em>Los Angeles Times</em></p><p>In the middle of the South Pacific, a thousand feet below the surface of the water, a huge vessel is discovered resting on the ocean floor.

But even more fantastic&#x2014;and frightening&#x2014;is what waits inside . . .</p><p>&#x201c;A page-turner with oomph. . . .

It relieves glaucoma, epilepsy, migraines, insomnia, asthma, the nausea associated with AIDS and chemotherapy, and a host of other conditions. It was once a staple in every American medicine cabinet, but because hemp is the plant from which marijuana is derived, it has been unavailable to consumers until recently. Now products made from imported hempseed are sold by stores and mail-order companies across the United States to satisfy a growing demand. <i>Hemp for Health</i> reveals the developments that have returned this ancient plant to the forefront of health and nutrition and that have doctors calling for its legalization. <br> <br>The author provides everything from recipes using hempseed, and an analysis of cannabis's therapeutic effect on the nervous system, to current information on bills that are currently moving through several state legislatures to legalize domestic hemp production .</p><p>A driving force behind Proposition 215, Chris Conrad has been educating others on the benefits of hemp for nearly a decade. He is the founder of the Business Alliance for Commerce in Hemp and the author of <i>Hemp: Lifeline to the Future</i>. He lives in Northern California.HEALTH / CURRENT AFFAIRS <br> <br>&#x201c;One of marihuana&#x2019;s greatest advantages as a medicine is its remarkable safety. It has little effect on major physiological functions. There is no known case of a lethal overdose. . . . Marihuana is also far less addictive and far less subject to abuse than many drugs now used as muscle relaxants, hypnotics, and analgesics. . . . The ostensible indifference of physicians should no longer be used as a justification for keeping this medicine in the shadows.&#x201d; <br>--<em>Journal of The American Medical Association, Commentary</em> <br> <br>On November 5, 1996, the people of California and Arizona voted overwhelmingly to allow doctors to prescribe medical marijuana to their patients. This marks the return of a medicine that has been used by humankind for at least 5,000 years. Marijuana is far and away the most effective medicine in relieving the symptoms of those with AIDS, cancer, glaucoma, arthritis, epilepsy, MS, and many other illnesses. <em>Hemp for Health</em> is the first book to explain all the facts about this exciting medicinal herb. <br> <br>Chris Conrad explores every facet of Cannabis <em>sativa&#x2019;s</em> healing properties, from its traditional uses in ancient China and India to the modern rediscovery of the nutritional benefits of nonpsychoactive hempseed. Hempseed is packed with protein, fiber, and essential fatty acids, which stimulate the immune system. <em>Hemp for Health</em> includes a section of recipes so that you can incorporate this ideal food into your diet immediately. <br> <br>In addition to examining the hundreds of scientific studies done on marijuana and explaining its therapeutic effects on each system of the body, Conrad includes practical information on how to get started with cannabis therapy, how to become part of the largest study of medical marijuana users ever undertaken, and what dangers--legal and otherwise--the prospective patient faces. <br> <br>A driving force behind Proposition 215, CHRIS CONRAD has been educating others on the benefits of hemp for nearly a decade.

Between 1925 and 1930, its author, Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa, wrote a number of letters to his cousins Casimiro and Lucio Piccolo in which he describes his travels around Europe (London, Paris, Zurich, and&nbsp;Berlin). The letters display much of Lampedusa's distinctive style present in his later work; not only the razor-sharp introspection, but also a wicked sense of humor, playful in its description of the <i>com�die humaine</i>. United and underpinned by the genre of the novel, Lampedusa's lifetime obsession, some letters also read like excerpts from a Stendhalian travel journal, while others are adventures populated with comic, exaggerated personalities.</p><p><p></p><p><b>Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa</b>, (1896&#x2013;1957)&nbsp;is famous for his only novel,&nbsp;<i>The Leopard</i>, published posthumously, which earned him&nbsp;the prestigious Strega Prize&nbsp;and became the basis of a now-classic film.&nbsp;<b>J.G. Nichols</b> has translated many of the greatest classics of Italian literature, including Dante's <i>Inferno</i>, Boccaccio's <i>Decameron</i> and Leopardi's <i>Canti</i>, and has been awarded the Florio Prize and the Monselice Prize for translation.</p><p>"The letters bring to mind E. F. Benson&#x2019;s Lucia novels . . . because of Lampedusa&#x2019;s ability to turn the most banal of events into a riveting story."&nbsp; &#x2014;<i>Telegraph</i><br><br></p><p>"These witty dispatches from an indolent aristocrat abroad are a real joy. . . . More than half a century after his death, Lampedusa has pulled off the characteristically insouciant coup of writing a brilliant travel book by accident."&nbsp; &#x2014;<i>Observer</i><br><br></p>"Intriguing...Di Lampedusa&#x2019;s love of literature and art resonates, as does a tantalizing obsession with food, cinema, and radio."&nbsp; &#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><h2>The Quest of the Fair Unknown (The Squire&#39;s Tales) (The Squire&#39;s Tales, 8)</h2><p>On her deathbed, Beaufils&#x2019;s mother leaves him with a quest and a clue: find your father, a knight of King Arthur&#x2019;s court. So Beaufils leaves the isolated forest of his youth and quickly discovers that he has much to learn about the world beyond his experience. Beaufils&#x2019;s innocence never fails to make his companions grin, but his fresh outlook on the world&#x2019;s peculiarities turns out to be more of a gift than a curse as they encounter unexpected friends and foes.<br><br>With his constant stream of wise fools and foolish wise men, holy hermits and others of rather less holiness, plotting magicians and conniving Ladies, Gerald Morris infuses these medieval stories with a riotous humor all his own.</p><p>When Gerald Morris was in fifth grade he loved Greek and Norse mythology and before long was retelling the stories to his younger sister and then to neighborhood kids. He began carrying a notebook in which he kept some of the details related to the different stories. The joy he found in retelling those myths continued when he discovered other stories. According to Gerald Morris, &#x201c;I never lost my love of retelling the old stories. When I found Arthurian literature, years later, I knew at once that I wanted to retell those grand tales. So I pulled out my notebook . . . I retell the tales, peopling them with characters that I at least find easier to recognize, and let the magic of the Arthurian tradition go where it will.&#x201d; Gerald Morris lives in Wausau, Wisconsin, with his wife and their three children. In addition to writing he serves as a minister in a church.Grade 5 Up&#x2013;Morris continues his tradition of effectively translating the tales of King Arthur for a new generation of readers. Beaufils spends the first 17 years of his life in a forest cottage with his loving mother, never meeting another human being. Then, upon her urging, he goes forth into the world of men, to seek out King Arthur's court and his erstwhile father. This unique background makes the protagonist the perfect foil for the other characters' antics. He bumbles along, innocently taming evil as he seeks his father and helps his friends complete their own quests. While less mature readers will be carried away by the compelling story line and interesting characters, more sophisticated teens will appreciate the dry wit with which Morris reveals his character's flaws. A heartwarming and thought-provoking tale, this story is sure to entertain readers.<i>&#x2013;Nicki Clausen-Grace, Carillon Elementary School, Oviedo, FL</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In <i>The Gourmands&#x2019; Way</i>, Justin Spring tells the story of six American writer-adventurers having the time of their lives in the City of Light during this period and, in doing so, transforming the way Americans talk and think about food&#x2015;and the way they eat.</p><p>The six are A. J. Liebling, Alice B. Toklas, M.F.K. Fisher, Julia Child, Alexis Lichine, and Richard Olney. <i>The Gourmands&#x2019; Way </i>is the first book ever to look at these unforgettable figures as a group. It is also the first to focus specifically on their Paris-based adventures. Liebling was a great war correspondent, reporter, and humorist who opens Spring&#x2019;s narrative by sweeping into Paris with the French and Allied forces in August 1944; Toklas was Gertrude Stein&#x2019;s life partner who reinvented herself at age seventy-five as a cookbook author; Fisher was a sensualist storyteller and fabulist; Child was a cookbook author, America&#x2019;s greatest television food celebrity, and the reinventor of the dinner party; Lichine was an ambitious wine merchant who, through an astounding series of risk-taking ventures, became the leading importer of French wines in America; and Olney was a reclusive but freewheeling artist who reluctantly evolved into one of the foremost American writers on French cuisine and French wine.</p><p>Justin Spring focuses on the most joyful, exciting, formative, and dramatic moments of these six lives, many of which were intimately connected to the exploration and discovery of fine French food and drink&#x2015;whether they experienced it at top Michelin-starred restaurants or straight from a hot plate in an artist&#x2019;s garret. <i>The Gourmands&#x2019; Way </i>leads us through both the fabled world of haute cuisine and the vibrant bohemian and artistic haunts of the Left Bank during the 1950s.

It looked as if it was running on its side, the way dogs run when they think they are chasing a cat in a dream. But the dog was not running or asleep. The dog was dead. There was a garden fork sticking out of the dog.&#39; The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is a murder mystery novel like no other. The detective, and narrator, is Christopher Boone. Christopher is fifteen and has Asperger&#39;s, a form of autism. He knows a very great deal about maths and very little about human beings. He loves lists, patterns and the truth. He hates the colours yellow and brown and being touched. He has never gone further than the end of the road on his own, but when he finds a neighbour&#39;s dog murdered he sets out on a terrifying journey which will turn his whole world upside down. Christopher is a brilliant creation, and Mark Haddon&#39;s depiction of his world is deeply moving, very funny and utterly convincing. The novel is being published simultaneously for adults by Jonathan Cape and for children by David Fickling, publisher of Philip Pullman. We are convinced that both audiences will recognise it as one of those very rare books that change the way you see everything.</p><p>Mark Haddon's bitterly funny debut novel, <i>The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time</i>, is a murder mystery of sorts--one told by an autistic version of Adrian Mole. Fifteen-year-old Christopher John Francis Boone is mathematically gifted and socially hopeless, raised in a working-class home by parents who can barely cope with their child's quirks. He takes everything that he sees (or is told) at face value, and is unable to sort out the strange behavior of his elders and peers.<p> Late one night, Christopher comes across his neighbor's poodle, Wellington, impaled on a garden fork. Wellington's owner finds him cradling her dead dog in his arms, and has him arrested. After spending a night in jail, Christopher resolves--against the objection of his father and neighbors--to discover just who has murdered Wellington. He is encouraged by Siobhan, a social worker at his school, to write a book about his investigations, and the result--quirkily illustrated, with each chapter given its own prime number--is <i>The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time.</i></p><p> </p><p> Haddon's novel is a startling performance. This is the sort of book that could turn condescending, or exploitative, or overly sentimental, or grossly tasteless very easily, but Haddon navigates those dangers with a sureness of touch that is extremely rare among first-time novelists. <i>The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time</i> is original, clever, and genuinely moving: this one is a must-read. <i>--Jack Illingworth, Amazon.ca</i></p>"Mark Haddon's portrayal of an emotionally dissociated mind is a superb achievement. He is a wise and bleakly funny writer with rare gifts of empathy.&#x201d;<br>-Ian McEwan, author of ATONEMENT and AMSTERDAM<br><br>"I have never read anything quite like Mark Haddon's funny and agonizingly honest book, or encountered a narrator more vivid and memorable. I advise you to buy two copies; you won&#x3c0;t want to lend yours out."<br>--Arthur Golden, author of MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA<br><br>&#x201c;<i>The Curious Incident</i> brims with imagination, empathy, and vision -- plus it's a lot of fun to read.&#x201d;<br>-Myla Goldberg, author of BEE SEASON</p><h2>Gazehounds &amp; Coursing - The History, Art and Sport of Hunting With Sighthounds</h2><p>This revised and expanded edition covers all the AKC sighthound breeds, plus the coldbloods, staghounds, coyote hounds, lurchers, etc. From the farm fields of the Midwest through the wind-swept North Plains to the desert Southwest, join the author on hunts for jackrabbits, coyotes, fox, and cottontails with a variety of purebred and mixed-breed hounds. Meet some of the great old houndmen of the past and the legacy and lore they left behind. Learn the technique of the trailhound/sighthound combination hunt. <i>Gazehounds &amp; Coursing</i> is provocative -- the author blasts the anti-hunters, insists on a strong conservation ethic, and says that some AKC breeds need an infusion of new blood to restore their working talents. <i>Gazehounds &amp; Coursing</i> is evocative -- the author recounts great hounds he loved well who have crossed the great divide, and game animals he wishes in retrospect had gotten away. Above all, <i>Gazehounds &amp; Coursing</i> is informative -- herein is the necessary methodology for choosing, raising, training, breeding, and running the lithe and graceful "longdogs."</p><p>We whose breath is taken by the sight of a pack of swift hounds sailing over the ground like unguided missiles should give a moment of thanks for the likes of M.H. Dutch Salmon. I suspect that most authors write more for the voice than the money, but I've never seen the trait more prominent than with the author of <i>Gazehounds &amp; Coursing</i>. Dutch will write about the subjects that touch his passions, and never mind that the work is monumental, the audience small, and the pay smaller. Because of his passions, <i>Gazehounds &amp; Coursing</i> is back in print, larger and more monumental than ever -- America's best and most complete representation of these ancient hounds of the hunt. -- <i>Larry Mueller, Hunting Dogs Editor, Outdoor Life Magazine</i></p><h2>The Boy Who Could See Demons: A Novel</h2><p>Bestselling author Carolyn Jess-Cooke has written a brilliant novel of suspense that delves into the recesses of the human mind and soul&#x2014;perfect for fans of Gillian Flynn and Lisa Unger. <i>The Boy Who Could See Demons</i> follows a child psychologist who comes up against a career-defining case&#x2014;one that threatens to unravel her own painful past and jeopardizes the life of a boy who can see the impossible.<br> &nbsp;<br> Dr. Anya Molokova, a child psychiatrist, is called in to work at MacNeice House, an adolescent mental health treatment center.

My demon is called Ruen, he&#x2019;s about five foot three, and his favorite things are Mozart, table tennis, and rice pudding.<br><br>I met Ruen and his friends five years, five months, and six days ago. It was the morning that Mum said Dad had gone, and I was at school. A bunch of very strange creatures appeared in the corner of the room beside the canvas we&#x2019;d made of the Titanic. Some of them looked like people, though I knew they weren&#x2019;t teachers or anyone&#x2019;s parents because some of them looked like wolves, but with human arms and legs. One of the females had arms, legs, and ears that were all different, as if they had belonged to different people and were pieced together like Frankenstein. One of her arms was hairy and muscly, the other was thin like a girl&#x2019;s. They frightened me, and I started to cry because I was only five.<br><br>Miss White came over to my desk and asked what was wrong. I told her about the monsters in the corner. She took off her glasses very slowly and pushed them into her hair, then asked if I was feeling all right.<br><br>I looked back at the monsters. I couldn&#x2019;t stop looking at the one who had no face but just a huge red horn, like a rhino&#x2019;s horn, only red, in his forehead. He had a man&#x2019;s body but it was covered in fur and his black trousers were held up with braces that were made out of barbed wire and dripping with blood. He was holding a long pole with a round metal ball on top with spikes sticking out of it like a hedgehog. He put a finger where his lips would be, if he had any, and then a voice appeared in my head. It sounded very soft and yet gruff, just like my Dad&#x2019;s:<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m your friend, Alex.&#x201d;<br><br>And then all the fear left me because what I wanted more than anything in the whole world was a friend.<br><br>I found out later that Ruen has different ways of appearing and this was the one I call the Horn Head, which is very scary, especially when you see it for the first time. Luckily he doesn&#x2019;t appear like that very often.<br><br>Miss White asked what I was staring at, because I was still looking at the monsters and wondering if they were ghosts, because some of them were like shadows. The thought of it made me start to open my mouth and I felt a noise start to come out, but before it grew too big I heard my Dad&#x2019;s voice, again in my head:<br><br>&#x201c;Be calm, Alex. We&#x2019;re not monsters. We&#x2019;re your friends. Don&#x2019;t you want us to be your friends?&#x201d;<br><br>I looked at Miss White and said I was fine, and she smiled and said okay and walked back to her desk, but she kept glancing back at me with her face all worried.<br><br>About a second later, without crossing the room, the monster who had spoken to me appeared beside me and told me his name was Ruen. He said I&#x2019;d better sit down otherwise Miss White would send me to talk to someone called A Psychiatrist. And that, Ruen assured me, would not involve anything fun, like acting or telling jokes or drawing pictures of skeletons.<br><br>Ruen knew my favorite hobbies so I knew there was something strange going on here. Miss White kept looking at me like she was very worried as she continued her lesson on how to stick a needle through a frozen balloon and why this was an important scientific experiment. I sat down and said nothing about the monsters.<br><br>Ruen has explained many things to me about who he is and what he does, but never about why I can see him when no one else can. I think we&#x2019;re friends. Only, what Ruen has asked me to do makes me think he&#x2019;s not my friend at all. He wants me to do something very bad.<br><br>He wants me to kill someone.</p><h2>English Artists&#39; Paper: Renaissance to Regency</h2><p>An international authority of paper and Senior Conservator for Paper at the Winterthur Museum, John Krill has written a detailed and interesting account of the evolution and types of paper available to artists in England from the Renaissance to the early nineteenth century. <p>The first chapter provides the basic information needed to understand hand papermaking and discusses each of the paper types.

Rain swept in great squalls off the ocean, snatching the words from my mouth. It was not a night to be standing on a clifftop in complete darkness. Our umbrella had given up the unequal struggle with the storm on the way from the station and now lay in a rubbish bin, its ribs sticking out like a large dead spider. Daniel had deposited it there despite my protests, stating that it was past all hope of repair.<br>It was a long walk from the station and not one that should have been attempted on a stormy night. But we had little choice. The directions we had been given were for a delightful afternoon stroll along a cliff path, with blue ocean below us. We had not anticipated that Daniel would be delayed with a last minute problem at headquarters and that what the locals called a nor&#x2019;easter would arrive at the same time as ourselves.<br>After changing trains in Providence, then again to a branch line in Kingston, we finally pulled into Newport station, at almost ten o&#x2019;clock. There was not a hansom cab or any kind of conveyance to be found. The town appeared to be battened down in anticipation of the coming storm. We&#x2019;d set off bravely enough under Daniel&#x2019;s big umbrella but once out of the town center, heading toward the clifftop footpath the full force of the wind had turned the umbrella inside out and ripped it to shreds in minutes.<br>&#x201c;Damn and blast it,&#x201d; Daniel had muttered, no longer apologizing if he swore in my presence now that I was married to him. &#x201c;We should have waited for the morning. I should not have listened to you.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What, and missed a whole day of our honeymoon?&#x201d; I demanded as I struggled to take off my new hat. It was a jaunty little concoction piled high with ribbons and lace and I certainly didn&#x2019;t want to lose it over the cliff. I stuffed it into my carpetbag, probably not doing it much good in the process but at least preventing it from sailing off into the ocean. &#x201c;Cheer up. I&#x2019;m sure it can&#x2019;t be far. Newport is only a small seaside town, isn&#x2019;t it? Just a few cottages, I was told.&#x201d;<br>Daniel had to chuckle at this and put an arm around my shoulders. &#x201c;You wait until daylight and then you&#x2019;ll see the extent of the cottages.&#x201d;<br>In my mind&#x2019;s eye I pictured a long road like the one leading into Westport in Ireland, with simple whitewashed cottages stretching along the side of the road facing the sea. It would be nice to be spending my honeymoon in a place that reminded me of home, I had thought when Daniel told me of this opportunity.<br>The walk turned from an annoyance into a frightening experience. We tried to follow a dark little street called Cliff Avenue, but it ended in a pair of high, locked gates, forcing us back to our original route along the cliff&#x2014;not what we would have chosen on a dark night. No lights shone out through the storm and we could hear the pounding waves crashing onto rocks below us. That cliff path seemed to go on forever and even I began to doubt the sense of wanting to reach our cottage tonight. Luckily the wind was blowing in from the ocean or I should have worried about being swept over that unseen cliff edge to our deaths.<br>&#x201c;Are you sure this is the right way?&#x201d; I shouted, grabbing on to Daniel&#x2019;s arm. &#x201c;Are there no roads in this place? Is this cottage not on a proper street?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Obviously,&#x201d; Daniel said tersely. &#x201c;But it never occurred to me to ask for foul weather directions. I assumed there would be a cab if we needed one.&#x201d;<br>I peered into the blackness. &#x201c;There are no lights. We can&#x2019;t be near any cottages. Surely the whole population of Newport doesn&#x2019;t go to bed by nine o&#x2019;clock?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s October. None of the cottages are likely to be inhabited at this time of year,&#x201d; Daniel shouted back. &#x201c;They are only used in the summer.&#x201d;<br>The thought of being the only people in a remote seaside village had seemed desirable when Daniel had presented it to me, our original honeymoon plans having fallen through when Daniel was summoned back to work two days after our wedding. I had borne this with remarkable patience for once, understanding that this was to be the lot of a policeman&#x2019;s wife. I think Daniel had been impressed by my stoicism and had promised me that we would escape from the city as soon as his work permitted. So when the offer of a seaside cottage had come up, he&#x2019;d jumped at it. Of course October was a little late in the year for beaches and bathing, but we had other activities in mind anyway. And this part of the country often experienced what they called an Indian summer, with glorious sunny days and glowing fall colors. Just not this year, it appeared.<br>&#x201c;Nearly there, I think.&#x201d; Daniel propelled me forward, his arm still around my waist. &#x201c;Then a bath and a hot drink will soon bring us to rights. Ah, this way. I believe we follow this wall and it will lead us to the gate.&#x201d;<br>As Daniel took my hand and guided me away from the cliff path, there was an ominous rumble of thunder overhead. A few moments later a flash of lightning lit up towering wrought-iron gates. Daniel felt for a latch but the gates refused to open.<br>&#x201c;Blast and damnation!&#x201d; he shouted. &#x201c;These infernal gates must open somehow.&#x201d; He shook them in frustration but they refused to budge.<br>&#x201c;They knew we were expected today, didn&#x2019;t they?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see any lights.&#x201d; I was soaked to the skin, my teeth chattering now, my hair plastered to my face, and my clothes clinging to me. All I wanted was to get indoors to a fire and a cup of tea.<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t understand it. I know the family is not usually here at this time of year, but there has to be a caretaker on the property,&#x201d; Daniel snapped out the words. &#x201c;But we have no way of alerting anyone, unless we walk back into town and see if we can reach the place by telephone.&#x201d;<br>This suggestion didn&#x2019;t seem too appealing. &#x201c;Everything seemed to be closed for the night in town. Besides we can&#x2019;t walk all the way back,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re already soaked to the skin. I don&#x2019;t suppose it&#x2019;s any good shouting.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No one would hear us with this infernal racket going on.&#x201d;<br>Thunder growled again and once again the scene was illuminated with a lighting flash. It revealed a long driveway behind those gates and in the distance the great black shape of what seemed to be an enormous castle. I stared in amazement.<br>&#x201c;I thought you said it was a cottage.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I wanted to surprise you,&#x201d; Daniel replied in an annoyed voice. &#x201c;The wealthy who own summer homes in Newport call them cottages but they are actually mansions. This one is called Connemara.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Holy mother of God,&#x201d; I muttered. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re not getting a whole mansion to ourselves are we?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No, we&#x2019;ve been offered the guest cottage on the property. If only we can find a way in.&#x201d; He rattled the gates again angrily.<br>I had been experiencing a growing sense of anxiety. It wasn&#x2019;t just the howl of the storm and the flashes of lightning. God knows I&#x2019;d seen enough storms on the West Coast of Ireland. It was something more. &#x201c;Daniel, don&#x2019;t let&#x2019;s stay here,&#x201d; I blurted out suddenly. &#x201c;Perhaps we should go back into town after all. There is bound to be a hotel or inn of some sort where we can spend the night. The house clearly doesn&#x2019;t want us.&#x201d;<br>Daniel gave me a quizzical smile. &#x201c;The house doesn&#x2019;t want us?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m getting this overwhelming feeling that we shouldn&#x2019;t be here, that we&#x2019;re not wanted.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You and your sixth sense,&#x201d; Daniel said. He was still prowling, staring up at the gates and the high stone wall. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll feel differently when we&#x2019;re safely inside. I am determined to find a way in, even if I have to scale that wall.&#x201d;<br>A great clap of thunder right overhead drowned out his last words and simultaneously the world was bathed in electric blue light. I was staring up at the house and I saw a face quite clearly framed in an upstairs window. It was a child&#x2019;s face and it was laughing with maniacal glee.<br>I let go of the bars of the gate as if burned. &#x201c;Come away!&#x201d; I shouted. &#x201c;We shouldn&#x2019;t be here.&#x201d;<br><br>&nbsp;<br>Copyright � 2012 by Rhys Bowen<br></p><h2>In Search of Klingsor: The International Bestselling Novel</h2><p>In his international bestseller <i>In Search of Klingsor,</i> Jorge Volpi takes us from the Institute of Advanced Study to the heart of Hitler's Germany, where the line between truth and lies is all but dissolved.Mysterious, seductive, and immediately engrossing, this startlingly accomplished thriller explores the nexus between science and human nature and how they shaped the world in the aftermath of World War II. In 1940, Francis Bacon, a brilliant young American physicist, is invited to join the prestigious institute at Princeton, the world's foremost physics research facility. But a series of personal indiscretions forces him to accept a different, more sinister, assignment: uncover "Klingsor," Hitler's top adviser on the scientific work in the Third Reich, including the race to create the first atomic bomb. Bacon's efforts to expose the truth lead him to Gustav Links, a survivor of the attempted coup against Hitler. With Link's help, he continues researching postwar Germany -- in an era when a secret was really a secret and a lie wasn't necessarily a sin -- and falls into a complicated relationship with an alluring woman. His search for Klingsor, an ominous and seemingly omnicient adversary, is part mystery, part psychological puzzle, part witty intellectual game. <i>In Search of Klingsor</i> places real people in speculative historical fiction, combining the ingenuity of a scientific investigation with the suspense of a great espionage novel.</p><p>An author, scholar and diplomat, Jorge Volpi has a BA in Law and a Master&#39;s in Mexican Literature. He is the author of nine novels and collections and is currently the cultural attache and director of the Mexican Culture Institute in Paris.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Spanish</p><h2>Twenty Shakespeare Children&#39;s Stories: The Complete Collection: Box Set</h2><p>A complete set of 20 stories by our favourite playwright, William Shakespeare - an excellent way to introduce young readers to these classic.

In her brilliantly researched first book, Nehring wrests romantic love from the clutches of retrograde feminists and cutting-edge capitalists, thrill-seeking convenience shoppers and safe-sex moralists. With help from celebrated lovers ranging from H�l�ise and Abelard to Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera, and from literature as diverse as Ovid's <em>Art of Love</em> and the poems of Emily Dickinson, Nehring celebrates the wild, irreverent, and uncompromising models of love we have inherited. As she rediscovers romantic love's fearless and heroic provenance, she challenges readers to demand partnerships that fully engage body, heart, and mind.</p><p>In an age when "settling" is encouraged and marriage is often described in business terms, Nehring's passionate defense of romantic love is timely and thoroughly refreshing. By reclaiming the right to love, to yearn, and&#x2014;yes&#x2014;to risk, <em>A Vindication of Love</em> aims to establish a new romantic paradigm for a new century.</p><p>A highly acclaimed and consistently provocative critic and essayist, Cristina Nehring has written for <em>Atlantic Monthly</em>, <em>Harper's</em>, the <em>New York Times Book Review</em>, <em>Cond� Nast Traveler</em>, <em>New York</em> magazine, <em>American Scholar</em>, the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>, and the <em>London Review of Books</em>, among other publications.

From the Berlin soundstages of Universum-Film AG emerged classics such as &#34;Metropolis&#34; and &#34;The Blue Angel&#34; and Hollywood luminaries such as Marlene Dietrich and Billy Wilder.

Near the buildings there is a hill made by the hands of men, on great foundations of stone. Beyond this hill there are two stone idols, of the human shape and figure, the features very skillfully carved, so that they appear to have been done by the hand of some great master. They are so large that they seem like small giants, and it is clear that they have on a sort of clothing different from those now worn by the natives of these parts.&#x201d; - Cieza de L�on, 1883 <br> Few ancient ruins capture the imagination like the mighty holy site of Tiwanaku, located on the high Andean altiplano plateau outside of La Paz, Bolivia. Unlike some ancient sites, such as Machu Picchu in neighboring Peru or Chichen Itz� in Mexico, Tiwanaku has never been &#x201c;lost&#x201d;; on the contrary, it has been marveled over for centuries by Incan nobles, Spanish Conquistadores, modern backpackers, and UFO fanatics alike. Despite this history of amazement, Tiwanaku has remained something of an enigma until recently, but it appears that this would have probably been pleasing to its creators. It was created to be a mysterious, sacred, and beautiful place, one with many secrets and a public face characterized by PT Barnum-like showmanship. <br> Skillful modern archaeology has allowed people to look behind the facade and see, for the first time in many, many centuries, some of the secrets behind it. The story is fascinating, complex, and thoroughly human. The modern visitor arriving to Tiahuanaco finds him or herself in, as Cieza de L�on noted almost 130 years ago, a not very notable, dusty, chilly settlement south of Lake Titicaca. The place would not be of any great interest except that to the east and south of the modern village, within walking distance of the center, rise a number of remarkable ruins. The eastern complex is the larger of the two and encompasses the ceremonial heart of the ancient settlement, including the massive Akapana Pyramid, the Kalasaya Temple, and the famed Puerta del Sol (Gate of the Sun). Visitors typically pose before this remarkable gateway, carved out of a single 10-ton block of andesite and decorated with elaborate carvings, including a curious figure in the center of a man bearing two rods or staffs in its hands. Visitors leaving this central complex travel south &#x2014; perhaps stopping at the Ceramic Museum, containing typical works of red and white geometric and zoomorphic images on red earthenware &#x2014; to the southern complex, centered on the famed ruins of Puma Punku. While this typically makes up the entirety of a visitor&#x2019;s time in the ruins, what is often overlooked is that these ceremonial buildings were surrounded by a vast array of lesser structures, many of which appear to have been cannibalized for their stone to build the modern town, especially the church of San Pedro in the main square (Bolivia es Turismo 2016). Beyond this was an impressive system of aqueducts and irrigation, broad expanses of carefully controlled fields, outlying settlements, and a vast network of dependent, conquered territories. Together they make up the political, spiritual, economic, and artistic world which today is called &#x201c;Tiwanaku,&#x201d; a place, empire, and cultural tradition that is the focus of this text. <br> Tiwanaku: The History and Legacy of the Ancient Pre-Colombian Site in the Heart of the Andes chronicles the history and archaeology of the famous site. Along with pictures depicting important people, places, and events, you will learn about Tiwanaku like never before.</p><p></p><h2>A Straw for Two (Ink Drinker)</h2><p>Bitten by an ink-drinking vampire who is allergic to blood, Odilon, the son of a bookstore owner, has become an ink drinker. Now he loves using a straw to devour books, but he has no one to share his secret with. He&#x2019;s lonely . . . until a new girl, Carmilla, arrives at school. Could he make her an ink drinker too? When Odilon follows Carmilla home, he discovers that she&#x2019;s just as special as he is, and that there&#x2019;s plenty for them to share. . . .<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p>Bitten by the word-slurping vampire Draculink, young Odilon became an ink drinker in the book by the same name, learning to live letter-by-letter as he drank the ink from the pages of books through a straw. In his vampiric state, Odilon is now light as a feather, quiet as a pair of slippers, and sharp-eyed as a cat ("courtesy of all the books about cats I've drunk"). He's lived "a thousand lives" through the stories he's sipped, becoming an astronaut, a pirate, and a pioneer. But something's wrong: "The hard part is that I can't share my straw with anyone. I'm very lonely." This problem forces him back to Draculink's dank, dark crypt to ask the unthinkable: "Mr. Draculink, can I bite a girl so that she becomes like me?"<p> But when Odilon returns to the lonely, old ink drinker, he's in for a surprise--alongside Draculink's long, wooden casket, he finds a second, smaller, suspiciously Odilon-sized box. Draculink can't be planning to adopt the unwilling young ink drinker! Before Odilon can guess Draculink's intentions, however, he discovers a girl worthy of his ink-thirsty bite, the new girl in class, Carmilla, "prettier than the prettiest girl in school." ("The assignment was to draw a map of our country, with the capital and the main cities. I drew a heart instead, with a capital named Carmilla," Odilon gushes.) But when he chases her, she runs toward the cemetery... home of Draculink's crypt!</p><p> Expect more inspired weirdness from Eric Sanvoisin, as he pens the worthy follow-up to the bizarrely lovable <i>The Ink Drinker</i>.

The government people had hearings all spring to solicit the views of residents on their plans. That&#x2019;s what they called it, soliciting views, but every last person in Miller&#x2019;s Valley knew that that just meant standing behind the microphones set up in the aisle of the middle school, and then finding out afterward that the government people would do what they planned to do anyhow. Everybody was just going through the motions. That&#x2019;s what people do. They decide what they want and then they try to make you believe you want it, too.<br><br> Donald&#x2019;s grandfather was at every meeting, his hands shaking as he held some sheets of loose-leaf he&#x2019;d been reading from so long that they were furred along the edges. He carried a big file with him everywhere, even when he went to the diner for breakfast. Early on he&#x2019;d switched out the original file for the accordion kind because the first one got too full. But it was full of the kind of stuff old guys pull together, newspaper clippings with uneven edges, carbon copies of letters ten years old, even the occasional sales receipt for a sump pump or a new well, as though someone was going to be inclined to pay him for all the years he&#x2019;d spent fighting the water. I always wondered if they wrote him off because his name was Elmer. The government people talked a lot about the future. Elmer was such an old guy&#x2019;s name, a piece of the past.<br><br> &#x201c;The best we can do is make sure we get as much as we can out of the bastards,&#x201d; Donald&#x2019;s grandfather said at what turned out to be the next-to-last meeting.<br><br> &#x201c;There&#x2019;s no need for that, Elmer,&#x201d; my mother said. She meant the profanity. She was as interested as the next person in milking the government for money. A lifetime working in hospitals had shown her the wisdom, and the ease, of that. She was upright but not stupid.<br><br> My mother was a person of stature in Miller&#x2019;s Valley. She&#x2019;d lived there all her life. Her mother had raised her and her younger sister, Ruth, in a one-story three-room house at the edge of the valley with a pitted asphalt roof and a falling-down porch, and when she&#x2019;d married my father and become a Miller she&#x2019;d moved to his family&#x2019;s farm, right at the center of the valley, in its lowest place, where the fog lay thick as cotton candy on damp mornings. She was a Miller of Miller&#x2019;s Valley, and so was I. People thought my mother could take care of just about anything. So did I, then.<br><br> The government people were all job titles instead of proper names. They dealt out thick business cards with embossed seals; we found them in our pockets and purses long after there was any point to it. There were geologists and engineers and a heavyset woman with a sweet smile who was there to help people relocate after the government took their houses. A resettlement counselor, they called her. She had the softest hands I&#x2019;d ever felt, pink and moist, and when she&#x2019;d come toward my mother, her hands like little starfish in the air, my mother would move in the opposite direction. It&#x2019;s hard to explain to kids today, with everybody touching each other all the time, kissing people who are more or less strangers, hugging the family doctor at the end of a visit, but my mother wasn&#x2019;t a huggie person, and neither were most of her friends and neighbors.<br><br>&#x201c;She can just forget about patting me, that one&#x201d; is what she always said about the resettlement counselor.<br><br> I felt kind of sorry for the woman. It was her job to make it sound as though one place to live was just as good as another, just as good as the place you&#x2019;d brought your babies home to from the hospital fifty years before, just as good as the place where your parents had died and, in a few cases that you could tell made the government people -really uncomfortable, were buried. They could make moving to a new house with a nice dry basement sound like a good deal, but there was no way they could put a pretty face on digging up a coffin that went into the ground before the First World War.<br><br> When people would talk about the government&#x2019;s plans, at the hospital, in the market, someone would always say, &#x201c;Can they really do that?&#x201d; The answer was yes. &#x201c;They can do what they want,&#x201d; my mother said, and when she did, Donald&#x2019;s grandfather held his file in front of him like a shield and said, &#x201c;Miriam, I don&#x2019;t think you understand the situation.&#x201d; But that wasn&#x2019;t true. My mother always understood the situation. Any situation.<br><br> &#x201c;I figure by my breathing I&#x2019;ll be gone by Sunday,&#x201d; she said years later when she was dying, and she was right on schedule.<br><br> At all the meetings they handed out little pamphlets with a drawing on the front of people walking around the edge of what looked like a big lake. There were sailboats, too, and a woman behind a motorboat on water skis with one arm held up in the air. Inside the pamphlet said, &#x201c;Flood control, water supply, hydroelectric power, and recreation: these are the advantages of water management in your area!&#x201d; On the back it said, &#x201c;A bright future through progress.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s a wiggly word, <i>progress:</i> a two-lane gravel road turned into four lanes paved that makes life a noisy misery for the people with houses there, a cornfield turned into a strip mall with a hair salon, a supermarket, and a car wash. Corn&#x2019;s better than a car wash. We washed our own cars with a garden hose until our kids got old enough to do it for us.<br><br> My eldest nephew, the smart one, did a project once about Miller&#x2019;s Valley, and he interviewed me one afternoon. &#x201c;Why didn&#x2019;t you fight?&#x201d; he said.<br><br> I understand. He&#x2019;s young. Things seem simple when you&#x2019;re young. I remember. I&#x2019;m not like some older people who forget.<br><br> There were people who fought, although there were fewer and fewer of them as the years went by. Donald&#x2019;s grandfather had printed up bumper stickers and buttons and tried to get people riled up, but there weren&#x2019;t that many people to begin with in the valley, and by the time it was all over there were hardly any at all.<br><br> I may have been the only person living in Miller&#x2019;s Valley who had read all the geologists&#x2019; reports, looked over all the maps, knew what was really going on. Somewhere there&#x2019;s an aerial photograph taken before I was even born, and if any reasonable person looked at it, at the dam and the course of the river and the unused land and the number of houses involved, they&#x2019;d conclude that there was a big low area just begging to be filled in with water. I&#x2019;d seen that photograph when I was seventeen, sitting in a government office with gray walls and metal furniture, looking at the center point of that big low area, at the roof of our house. I knew better than anyone what the deal was. When I was a kid I&#x2019;d play in the creek, stack up stones and sticks and watch the water back up behind them, until finally it filled a place that had been dry before. The difference is that with a real dam, sometimes the place that fills up with water has houses and churches and farms. I saw a picture once of a big reservoir behind a dam in Europe that had a church steeple sticking up on one side during a dry spell.<br><br> That&#x2019;s what they meant when they talked about water management, the government people, except that we didn&#x2019;t have a steeple high enough in the valley to stick up and remind people that there had once been a place where the water would be. A bright future through progress. There was just a handful of us in the way.<br><br> Everyone was waiting for my mother to fight, although no one ever said that. Everyone was waiting for her to say that they couldn&#x2019;t do this, take 6,400 acres of old family farms and small ramshackle homes and turn it into a reservoir by using the dam to divert the river. Everyone was waiting for her to say that they couldn&#x2019;t just disappear our lives, put a smooth dark ceiling of water over everything as though we had never plowed, played, married, died, lived in Miller&#x2019;s Valley. It wasn&#x2019;t just that my mother had lived in the valley, had dealt with the water, her whole life long. It wasn&#x2019;t just that she was the kind of person who preferred to solve her problems by herself, not have some people come in from outside in suits and ties and work shoes that weren&#x2019;t work shoes at all, to handle things for her and her neighbors.<br><br> It was that she was someone, Miriam Miller. There are just some people like that. Everyone pays attention to what they say, even if they don&#x2019;t even know them well or like them much.<br><br> My mother went to every meeting the government people held, but she never spoke, and when people would try to talk to her before or after she was polite but no more, asking after their children or their arthritis but never saying a word about the plans to drown Miller&#x2019;s Valley. I drove up from the city for that one meeting at the church, even though she said there was no need for me to miss school or work, even though my desk was piled high with things that needed to be done. I guess I did it because I&#x2019;d been there from the very beginning years before, when I was a kid selling corn from a card table outside of our barn, when the talk about turning Miller&#x2019;s Valley into a reservoir first began, when no one really thought it would amount to anything.<br><br> It&#x2019;s so easy to be wrong about the things you&#x2019;re close to. I know that now. I learned that then.<br> When the meeting was over my mother and I drove home together down the dark back roads to the farm, and as I took the curves fast, curves I&#x2019;d been taking since I&#x2019;d gripped the wheel of the truck while sitting on my father&#x2019;s lap, she stared out the window so that the sickly green of the dashboard dials just touched the corner of her set jaw.<br><br> &#x201c;You do understand this, right?&#x201d; I&#x2019;d said. &#x201c;If this goes through they&#x2019;ll take the house and the barn and the little house. If this happens you&#x2019;ll have to move. You&#x2019;ll have to pack up all your stuff. You&#x2019;ll have to find a place for Aunt Ruth and pack up all her stuff. You&#x2019;ll have to find a way to get her out of there. Then it&#x2019;s going to be like none of it ever existed. They&#x2019;re going to put the whole place under forty feet of water.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not stupid, Mary Margaret,&#x201d; my mother said. The night was so quiet you could hear the wood doves comforting themselves with their own soft voices in the fields.<br><br> &#x201c;If this happens they&#x2019;re going to make the valley just disappear,&#x201d; I said, my voice harsh in the silence.<br><br> A deer ran through my headlights like a ghost, and I slowed down because, like my father always said, there&#x2019;s almost never just one. Sure enough, two more skittered out. They froze there, staring, then moved on. I was ready to start talking again when my mother spoke.<br> &#x201c;Let them,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Let the water cover the whole damn place.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I&nbsp;grew up to the sound of my parents talking in the kitchen on my mother&#x2019;s nights off, and the sound of the sump pump when it rained. Sometimes, all these years later, I wake up in the middle of the night and think I hear one or the other, the faint pounding of the throttle or the murmur of those two low voices. On a wet night the best I could ever make out was a little muttering even if my mother and father were talking loud. If you properly maintain it, and my father did, a sump pump makes a throaty chug-a-chug noise, sort of like a train without the whistle. My brother Tommy always said he liked the sound, but I think it was because it meant he could sneak out at night without anyone hearing. My mother didn&#x2019;t mind it because her shift work meant she was hardly ever at home at night, and so tired when she got home that nothing kept her awake.<br><br> My room was in the back corner of the house, right over where the sump pump sat on the cement basement floor two stories below. From the window in my room you could see the path up to the back end of the property and the lights through the trees of my aunt Ruth&#x2019;s house. She kept at least one light on all night long. I liked looking out and seeing that light in the darkness, something that had always been there, that I could count on. It was real quiet most of the time around our house at night, so quiet that sometimes I could tell what Aunt Ruth was watching on television because I could hear the theme song of <i>The Dick Van Dyke Show.<br></i><br> There was a heating vent right behind the head of my bed, and if you followed it down it stopped at the heating vent behind the kitchen table before it ended up at the old cast--iron furnace in the basement. When I was five I thought my room was haunted because just as I was dropping off to sleep I would hear a moaning sound underneath my bed. Years later my brother Eddie told me that Tommy had put his mouth to the vent and made the noise and Eddie made him stop when he caught him, and all of that made sense, including Eddie saying he hadn&#x2019;t mentioned any of it to our parents.<br><br> The thing was, listening to my parents through that vent was like a bad radio broadcast, one of those where you&#x2019;ve got a song on you really like but it&#x2019;s from fifty miles away and it drifts in and out and you have to fill in the gaps by singing along. I was good at filling in the gaps when my parents talked, and I probably heard a lot I shouldn&#x2019;t have. If it had been LaRhonda listening, the whole town would have known, too. You could close that heating vent with a little chain at one corner, and I always did when LaRhonda slept over. But the rest of the time I paid attention to whatever I managed to hear.<br><br> She&#x2019;s got cancer in that breast, my mother might say.<br><br> That&#x2019;ll be hard on Bernie, my father would say.<br><br> Bernie? It&#x2019;ll be hard on her, is who it&#x2019;ll be hard on. From what I hear Bernie has plenty of female companionship.<br><br> Gossip, my father would say. Then silence, and I would fall asleep.<br><br> Or, That baby is going right into the state hospital, no questions asked, my mother might say.<br> That&#x2019;s a sad thing, my father would say.<br><br> Sadder to keep it at home, my mother would say.<br><br> Guess so, my father would say. She was always sure of things. He almost never was, except maybe about the government people and their plans for Miller&#x2019;s Valley. Over the years there was a lot of talk about that at night in the kitchen.<br><br> Talked to Bob Anderson yesterday, my mother might say.<br><br> Got no business with a real estate agent, my father replied.<br><br> Asking for you, my mother said.<br><br> Fine right where I am, my father said.<br><br> Clattering pans in the sink. Tap running.<br><br> Why I even bother, my mother said.<br><br> &#x201c;Meems, you up?&#x201d; Tommy whispered, pushing&nbsp;open the door. When he wanted to he could move through the house like a ghost, even when he was drunk. Maybe especially when he was drunk.<br> &#x201c;How come you&#x2019;re home?&#x201d; I said, sitting up against the headboard.<br><br> Not listening to one more word on the subject, said my father.<br><br> &#x201c;Oh, man, not again,&#x201d; said Tommy. He sat down on the edge of my bed and canted his head toward the vent so that a piece &nbsp;of hair fell down on his forehead. It was confusing, having a good-looking brother. I tried not to think of him that way, but LaRhonda wouldn&#x2019;t shut up about it.<br><br> &#x201c;What are they talking about?&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s Bob Anderson?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Did the water department guy stop by here today?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Who?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Did some guy in a Chevy sedan come by to see Pop?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;There&#x2019;s so...</p><h2>American General: The Life and Times of William Tecumseh Sherman</h2><p><b>From respected historian John S. D. Eisenhower comes a surprising portrait of William Tecumseh Sherman, the Civil War general whose path of destruction cut the Confederacy in two, broke the will of the Southern population, and earned him a place in history as &#x201c;the first modern general.&#x201d; Yet behind his reputation as a fierce warrior was a sympathetic man of complex character. </b><br><br>A century and a half after the Civil War, Sherman remains one of its most controversial figures&#x2014;the soldier who brought the fight not only to the Confederate Army, but to Confederate civilians as well. Yet Eisenhower, a West Point graduate and a retired brigadier general (Army Reserves), finds in Sherman a man of startling contrasts, not at all defined by the implications of &#x201c;total war.&#x201d; His scruffy, disheveled appearance belied an unconventional and unyielding intellect. Intensely loyal to superior officers, especially Ulysses S. Grant, he was also a stalwart individualist. Confident enough to make demands face-to-face with President Lincoln, he sympathetically listened to the problems of newly freed slaves on his famed march from Atlanta to Savannah. Dubbed &#x201c;no soldier&#x201d; during his years at West Point, Sherman later rose to the rank of General of the Army, and though deeply committed to the Union cause, he held the people of the South in great affection.<br><br>In this remarkable reassessment of Sherman&#x2019;s life and career, Eisenhower takes readers from Sherman&#x2019;s Ohio origins and his fledgling first stint in the Army, to his years as a businessman in California and his hurried return to uniform at the outbreak of the war. From Bull Run through Sherman&#x2019;s epic March to the Sea, Eisenhower offers up a fascinating narrative of a military genius whose influence helped preserve the Union&#x2014;and forever changed war.</p><p><b>John S. D. Eisenhower&nbsp;</b>(1922-2013) was a brigadier general (Army Reserves), a U.S. ambassador to Belgium during the Nixon administration, and the author of numerous works of military history and biography. He was the son of President Dwight D. Eisenhower.<p></p><p></p><p>FOREWORD</p><p></p><p></p><p>It is hard to articulate the sum of a life. But my father, John S. D. Eisenhower, who died before the publication of this book, produced a loving family and accomplished his professional goals. The only surviving son of Mamie and General and President Dwight D. Eisenhower, John Eisenhower wore his father&#x2019;s fame with dignity and resolve. By midcareer, he had gotten into &#x201c;the writing game&#x201d; to fulfill his desire to be an author. He also knew it would help him create an identity of his own. In the succeeding decades he made an independent reputation for himself, becoming what the <i>Washington Post </i>called &#x201c;a soldier, diplomat and acclaimed historian.&#x201d;</p><p>John Eisenhower&#x2019;s life was utterly shaped by the military. As a young man, he moved with his parents from army assignment to assignment, in places like Panama and the Philippines. After high school he sought an appointment to West Point. After three years he graduated from the Academy coincidentally on June 6, 1944, just hours after the invasion of Normandy had begun. He served in intelligence posts in Europe before the war ended, and later in combat operations in Korea. He left the Army in 1963 to pursue his love of writing.</p><p>Becoming a military historian was, for John Eisenhower, more than a vocation. &#x201c;Putting pen to paper&#x201d; is not just what he did; being a writer is who he was. He knew this even before he graduated from West Point. After VE Day he got a master&#x2019;s degree at Columbia University and was assigned to the English Department at West Point. Between 1948 and 1951, he was, in his own words, &#x201c;able to learn much of what he and the Class of 1944 had missed because of West Point&#x2019;s [foreshortened graduation schedule] during the war.&#x201d; His master&#x2019;s thesis was on the role of the military in William Shakespeare&#x2019;s work. In addition to military histories, he loved humorists like Mark Twain and P. G. Wodehouse and appreciated the lean, evocative style of Ernest Hemingway.</p><p>In the late 1960s, after serving as an editor on Ike&#x2019;s two-volume White House memoirs, my father wrote his first book, <i>The Bitter Woods</i>, on the Battle of the Bulge. He undertook extensive research on the subject, which included doing interviews at all echelons in the chain of command, including those who fought on the German side. I remember vividly dining with the 5th Panzer Army General Hasso von Manteuffel after his interview with my father at our house in Pennsylvania. The German general had played a significant role in the Battle of the Bulge.</p><p>After <i>The Bitter Woods</i> appeared on bestseller lists, my father was appointed as U.S. Ambassador to Belgium, and he served in that capacity from 1969 to 1971. During his tenure my parents rented a small cottage in the Ardennes forest, and on my visits &#x201c;home&#x201d; he would take me out on battlefield excursions, much like he did with my other siblings.</p><p>As my father&#x2019;s career developed, he and I made trips to a number of Civil War battlefields, family landmarks and other points of historic interest. There he would try to learn more, all the while he told me stories and explained the significance or the strategic importance of the place.</p><p>My father was a cerebral man&#x2014;a quiet observer of the many things to which he&#x2019;d been exposed. He had done a lot of living. During the war in Europe, he&#x2019;d been to Buchenwald and seen the Holocaust firsthand. He was a combat officer in the Korean War, and that conflict also left a deep imprint on him. Perhaps, notably, he may have been the last person alive who had dined with both Churchill and Stalin&#x2014;and he went with his father to Normandy just after the invasion. He wrote several books on World War II, but on subjects he later tackled&#x2014;from General Winfield Scott and the War of 1812 to the United States&#x2019; intervention in Mexico and World War I&#x2014;he used his love of writing as a gateway to a lifetime of intellectual discovery. He had an instinct for detail and an eye for spotting uncommon capabilities, historic ironies, and the elements of a good story. </p><p>What impressed me the most was his extraordinary ability to connect the intellectual dots across centuries of history and articulate them as simple principles, often associating them with the events of the day. He had a striking ability to identify the exceptional qualities in people that made them leaders, as well as the ones that made others fall short.</p><p>With respect to our society, it was the changing mores and attitudes that fascinated him. In this, he saw the hand of time as a mysterious &#x201c;fourth dimension,&#x201d; which altered things as no physical change ever could. </p><p>My father also liked colorful characters&#x2014;he knew a few in his day. Perhaps this is what drew him to General Sherman in the first place. It was Sherman who famously said: &#x201c;War is hell.&#x201d; Indeed, fact and lore reveal a quick-witted Sherman who didn&#x2019;t hesitate to speak his mind. One such example relates to Sherman&#x2019;s disdain for journalists, whom the General deemed as nothing better than battlefield spies and gossipmongers. On hearing that three correspondents had been killed near Vicksburg, Sherman is said to have quipped, &#x201c;Good! Now we shall have news from Hell before breakfast.&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>In the course of his lifetime, John Eisenhower edited three books and wrote thirteen others. <i>American General</i> was his fourteenth. It was under way in the last two years of his life. Just as my father was preparing this book for the editor, he died on December 21, 2013, at age ninety-one. In fact, the manuscript was the subject of my last conversation with him, shortly before he passed away. He asked that I serve as his &#x201c;stand-in&#x201d; for getting the book ready for publication.</p><p>While no one could ever hope to substitute for John Eisenhower, I have been privileged to play a small role in helping to bring this project to fruition, an important piece of his body of work. </p><p>My father&#x2019;s legacy will become clearer with the fullness of time. But it was gratifying to read the many articles written about his life and to receive countless letters from people who&#x2019;d read his books. The field of military and leadership history, many observers wrote, is richer today because John Eisenhower devoted himself to the writing craft. </p><p>Sage insights on world leaders, observations about strategy and its impact, and sensitivity to the fighting man&#x2019;s condition are part of what my father leaves behind. His determination to be his own man, to pursue his talents and to forge his own identity, is also how he will be remembered&#x2014;and another reason for why he will be missed. </p><p></p><p></p><p>INTRODUCTION</p><p>The Tactical Department at the United States Military Academy, West Point, in evaluating the Class of 1840, dubbed the sixth-highest-ranking cadet in the class, William Tecumseh Sherman, as &#x201c;no soldier.&#x201d; A century later, General George S. Patton would use the same term in describing Terry Allen and Teddy Roosevelt Jr., two of the most pugnacious infantrymen of World War II. Both the West Point tacs and &#x201c;Old Blood and Guts&#x201d; made the same error; they equated spit and polish with &#x201c;soldiering.&#x201d; Sherman&#x2019;s appearance was rough-hewn, with scraggly red hair. His uniforms were always rumpled. Using that criterion, of course, they were both right.</p><p>Sherman was not concerned with that evaluation. Indeed, in later years he reveled in it. Even at the time, it seemed to cause him no grief. Actually, if required to summarize this otherwise complex man, I for one would be inclined to call him a &#x201c;soldier&#x2019;s soldier.&#x201d;</p><p>Sherman&#x2019;s basic attitudes were typically military. He was physically fearless&#x2014;or appeared so. He distrusted politicians and the press, considering the latter to be licensed spies. He was loyal to a fault, both to the office of his superiors and certainly to Ulysses S. Grant personally. But Sherman could never be put in a mold. He was one of the most colorful figures of the American Civil War, or any other American war. To many people he is best remembered for his answer to the suggestion that he run for the presidency: &#x201c;If nominated, I will not run. If elected, I will not serve. If given the choice between four years in the presidency or four years in prison, I will choose prison, thank you.&#x201d; He put a new word in our language: &#x201c;Shermanesque.&#x201d;</p><p>These idiosyncrasies, however, are not the reason we remember Sherman. The military historian B. H. Liddell Hart called him &#x201c;the first of the modern generals.&#x201d; If that evaluation seems to be a bit of an exaggeration, it must be admitted that Sherman was a truly independent thinker. Conventionality was not part of his makeup. And part of his original thinking was the concept that to conquer a nation determined to resist, the attacking force cannot limit its efforts to that people&#x2019;s armed forces; the war must be waged against the will of the civilian populace as well. Hence the term &#x201c;total war.&#x201d; Only one other Civil War general, the venerable Winfield Scott, also realized what has become a truism. But not until Sherman made his vaunted march from Atlanta to Savannah in late 1864 did it come to be universally acknowledged. The victims of this concept, the American Confederacy, have never forgiven him for it.</p><p>Actually, it is too much to give Sherman credit for discovering the feasibility of an army&#x2019;s living off the land of the enemy, free of its own supply lines. He seems to have learned that lesson from U. S. Grant at Vicksburg, when Grant, having secured a foothold on the lands south of the city, attacked Jackson, Mississippi, without a supply line. In fact, the discovery was not even Grant&#x2019;s. Henry W. Halleck, in 1862, lived off the land in his large-scale movement from Shiloh to Corinth. But Sherman was the first to adopt the policy for purposes beyond feeding his troops: that of depriving the enemy of all mat�riel necessary to war as well as making use of it himself.</p><p>In writing this short book I found his personality even more interesting than his deeds. The contrast between Sherman&#x2019;s true affection for the people of the South and his actions toward them is to me mind-boggling. (Of course, unreconstructed Southerners hardly return that affection.) When the military phase of the Civil War was finished, he made a sentimental trip to Charleston, South Carolina, to check on the welfare of the friends of twenty years earlier. (He found almost none.)</p><p>It is the combination of military genius and complexity of character that has made this book a joy to write. Sherman&#x2019;s major role in bringing about the ultimate Union triumph in the Civil War, along with being the most unlikely general, is unique in American military history.</p><p></p><p></p><p>PROLOGUE</p><p>In early 1861, a forty-one-year-old ex-soldier named William Tecumseh Sherman, then president of the Louisiana State Seminary of Learning &amp; Military Academy (later Louisiana State University), was dining with Professor David F. Boyd, a dear friend from Virginia, a state contemplating secession from the Union. As recalled by Boyd, Sherman minced no words:</p><p>You people of the South don&#x2019;t know what you are doing. This country will be drenched in blood, and God only knows how it will end. It is all folly, madness, a crime against civilization! You people speak so lightly of war; you don&#x2019;t know what you&#x2019;re talking about. War is a terrible thing! You mistake, too, the people of the North. They are a peaceable people but an earnest people, and they will fight, too. They are not going to let this country be destroyed without a mighty effort to save it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Besides, where are your men and appliances of war to contend against them? The North can make a steam engine, locomotive, or railway car; hardly a yard of cloth or pair of shoes can you make. You are rushing into war with one of the most powerful, ingeniously mechanical, and determined people on Earth&#x2014;right at your doors. You are bound to fail. Only in your spirit and determination are you prepared for war. In all else you are totally unprepared, with a bad cause to start with. At first you will make headway, but as your limited resources begin to fail, shut out from the markets of Europe as you will be, your cause will begin to wane. If your people will but stop and think, they must see in the end that you will surely fail.1</p><p>Sherman knew whereof he spoke. With remarkable prescience, he described as concisely as can be imagined the tragedy that was about to befall the United States, the American Civil War. He had no inkling of the major role he would play in this drama, something that seemed to come about almost by chance. There was little in his background that would presage it.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Book I</p><p></p><p></p><p>CHAPTER ONE</p><p></p><p></p><p>On a cold and windy day in mid-February 1891, an elaborate funeral was held in New York City for general of the army William Tecumseh Sherman. All the important people were there: Among them were President Benjamin Harrison, former presidents Rutherford B. Hayes and Grover Cleveland, and thirty thousand troops, including the entire corps of cadets from West Point. One of the honorary pallbearers, present at Sherman&#x2019;s previous request, was an unlikely member: Joseph Eggleston Johnston, a onetime general of the Confederate States of America and Sherman&#x2019;s fierce antagonist. The two men&#x2014;with a fourteen-year difference in their ages&#x2014;had fought hard against each other during the Civil War, but in later years they had developed a warm friendship, working together to repair the Union that had been rent asunder between the years 1861 and 1865.</p><p>Johnston&#x2019;s friends were worried about him, for despite the icy winds, his eighty-four years of age, and frail health, he insisted on remaining bareheaded throughout the ceremony. Johnston would have none of his friends&#x2019; protests. &#x201c;If I were in [Sherman&#x2019;s] place, and he were standing in mine, he would not put on his hat.&#x201d; A month later Johnston died of pneumonia, presumably the result of exposure at Sherman&#x2019;s funeral.</p><p>Johnston&#x2019;s affection for Sherman, expressed at risk to himself, was contrary to the feelings of his fellow Southerners; Sherman&#x2019;s name, in fact, still stands as a symbol of the destruction he visited on their lands while marching from Atlanta to Savannah in late 1864. The contrast between those who knew him as a warm and somewhat sensitive man and those who knew him only by the measures he took in war characterizes the contrasts of Sherman&#x2019;s life. He was a man who hated war and all it stood for, but whose duty, as he saw it, called for measures designed to finish off a failing enemy.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>Sherman came from a prominent family, but little in his ancestry indicated that one day he would be recognized as one of the nation&#x2019;s most brilliant generals. If anything, his background should have led him to the legal profession. He was born in 1820 in Lancaster, Ohio, to Charles Sherman, Esq., and his wife, Mary Sherman. Charles Sherman was a distinguished lawyer, a member of the Ohio Supreme Court. The Sherman family had come from Essex County, England, in two groups; William Sherman&#x2019;s family came to Connecticut in 1636. A cousin, Roger Sherman, had been a signer of the Declaration of Independence. The boy&#x2019;s grandfather, Taylor Sherman, had moved out to the west and settled in Ohio. Charles R. Sherman, William&#x2019;s father, had moved his family...</p></p><h2>Firsthand: Ditching Secondhand Religion for a Faith of Your Own</h2><p><b>New York Times Bestseller</b><br><br>Join us on a journey to find a faith of your own.<br>A faith that isn't your parents' or your youth pastor's or your church's.<br>Start from scratch, question everything, and get hold of a faith that's real.<br>We call it firsthand faith.<br><b>&nbsp;</b><br>"It's rare to find young people unafraid to voice their doubts while still being bold in their faith.

It is a landmark work that captures the fundamental themes of Steven&#39;s experimental research and his vision of what psychophysics and psychology are and can be. The context of this modern classic is detailed by Lawrence Mark&#39;s pungent and highly revealing introduction. The search for a general psychophysical law-a mathematical equation relating sensation to stimulus-pervades this work, first published in 1975. Stevens covers methods of measuring human psychophysical behavior; magnitude estimation, magnitude production, and cross-modality matching are used to examine sensory mechanisms, perceptual processes, and social consensus. The wisdom in this volume lies in its exposition of an approach that can apply generally to the study of human behavior.</p><p><p>Lawrence E. Marks is a fellow of the John B.

That came to a crashing halt when he was diagnosed with leukemia on April first. After a year-long period of treatment and recovery he started a sketchbook called The Daily Zoo on the anniversary of his diagnosis. Over the next 365 days he would draw one animal each day, challenging both his self-discipline and imagination. Most importantly it would allow him the focused opportunity to celebrate the gift of each healthy day. The pages of The Daily Zoo: Volume One are chock-filled with 365 distinct critters, ranging from curious pandas to sinister hyenas, athletic aardvarks to zealous zebras, and his choice of artistic styles are as diverse as his subject matter. Alongside the images Ayers, whose big screen credits include Men in Black II, X-Men 3, and the Alien vs. Predator films, ties in commentary about his cancer experience, the sources of his artistic inspiration and his creative methods. Whether you&#39;re a beginning artist or a seasoned pro, this book will leave you inspired to grab the nearest pencil, pen, brush or crayon and start drawing!</p><p><p>Chris Ayers popped out onto this Planet Earth scene on a sweltering July afternoon in 1975. Shortly thereafter he discovered a groovy magic wand made of wood called a "pencil." Through trial and error, and lots of practice, he learned that these nifty little things gave him the means to unlock the worlds of his imagination and give them visual form on paper.<br><br> During these early formative years his spongy gray matter soaked up as much as it could about the fascinating world around him, especially in regards to the animal kingdom, dinosaurs, Sesame Street, Star Wars, Disney, art, mythology, monsters in closets, spaceships, Robin Hood, Ray Harryhausen, pirates, extra-terrestrial friends and foes, Jules Verne, Dr. Seuss, Bill Peet, comic book heroes and villains, animation, cartoons...<br><br> Fast-forward about twenty years to the spring of 2000.

He had long dreamt of someday working in the movies and, at age 24, it seemed like the right time in his life to give it a shot.<br><br> Fast forward another eight years and he is still driving a Toyota Tercel around the bustling freeways of the City of Angels. His dream of working in the film industry has come true - and then some. Working as a character designer and concept artist he has been involved in some challenging and fun projects such as Men In Black II, Fantastic Four, Incredible Hulk and The Santa Clause 2.<br><br> In 2006, on the one-year anniversary of his diagnosis, he started a sketchbook called The Daily Zoo and set out to draw one animal each day for a year.

Two years ago she lost her mother to a long, lingering illness and now the body of the woman her father married in an attempt to replace his wife has been found on a railway embankment close to the Franklin farm. This time the death is murder. As Superintendent Markby, one of the first on the scene, well knows, Tammy now stands to have her father taken from her, for Hugh Franklin is suspect number one in the mind of the inspector to whom Markby has delegated the case. But, despite his need to distance himself from the murder, Markby begins to realise that the truth is destined to be far more complex than he ever envisaged ...</p><p>Ann Granger has lived in cities all over the world, since for many years she worked for the Foreign Office and received postings to British embassies as far apart as Munich and Lusaka. She is now permanently based in Oxfordshire.Yet another homicide for Superintendent Alan Markbys Bamford precinct (Call the Dead Again, 1999, etc.). Widower Hugh Franklin, owner of none-too-prosperous Hazelwood Farm and father of 12-year-old Tammy, had taken another wife, fun-loving, man-chasing Sonia Lambert. As might be predicted, the marriage had never worked too well, but Hugh, his bookish brother Simon, and everyone who knew her are shocked when Sonias body, stabbed to death, is found on a nearby railway embankment by gypsy Danny Smith. As Markby and newly promoted Inspector Dave Pearce begin their investigation, Jane Brady, Tammys teacher at St. Clares, tries to help but soon suspects that Tammy is hiding something. Markbys girlfriend Meredith Mitchell, a Foreign Service worker now based in London and owner of an ancient cottage in Bamford, also tries to help by checking out the suspects who had reason to cheer Sonias death. The line begins just down the road from Hazelwood Farm, at the modest B&amp;B run by Derry and Belinda Haywood. Derry was one of Sonias flings; so was woodworker Peter Burke, once involved with Jane. Simon Franklin, recently broken up and then reconciled with Bethan Talbot, was another of Sonias targets. Not until Merediths house has been thoroughly vandalizedand Derry Haywood viciously attacked, and Tammy has told alldoes the solution arrive. The customary assortment of intriguing locals adds interest and a bit of tension to a generally phlegmatic plot: a boon, nevertheless, to lovers of the British village procedural. -- <i>Copyright �2000, Kirkus Associates, LP.

He vanquishes other electronic realms via portal, killing everyone&#x2014;sentient or not, he doesn't care. But Scanthax, lacking DNA, can't script new weapons. For that, he's preserved the life of the only human left on the uninhabitable planet that houses Edda's servers. Scanthax-controlled robots tend 15-year-old Penelope'sunderused physical body inside an airlock. Penelope's brain and consciousness are healthy and angry: Her avatar, Princess, has the run of Edda, but only as long as Penelope scripts the weapons Scanthax demands. Penelope wants, as Princess, to search other electronic worlds for avatars with humans behind them; having known only Scanthax her entire life, she craves human connection. Meanwhile, across this chain of worlds that were once games, electronic but very real Ghost from Saga sets out with human Erik from New Earth&#x2014;as avatar Cindella&#x2014;to find the conqueror threatening Saga's sentient inhabitants. Combatants clash; worlds clash (techno/punk, traditional fantasy, military); philosophies clash (pacifism, preservation, revenge); loyalties hold steady.Humans, electronic beings and servers are separated by light years and metaphysics, but Kostick's action-filled series conclusion is immediate and relevant.

What started out as a day trip spirals into a nightmare when they reach the ruins . . . and discover the terrifying presence that lurks there.</p><p>In 1993, Scott Smith wowed readers with <i>A Simple Plan</i>, his stunning debut thriller about what happens when three men find a wrecked plane and bag stuffed with over 4 million dollars--a book that Stephen King called "Simply the best suspense novel of the year!" Now, thirteen years after writing a novel that turned into a pretty great movie featuring Bill Paxton and Billy Bob Thornton, Smith is back, with <i>The Ruins</i>, a horror-thriller about four Americans traveling in Mexico who stumble across a nightmare in the jungle. Who better to tell readers if Smith has done it again than the undisputed King of Horror (and champion of Smith's first book)? We asked Stephen King to read <i>The Ruins</i> and give us his take. Check out his review below. <i>--Daphne Durham</i><br><p> </p><strong>Guest Reviewer: Stephen King</strong><br><br><b>Stephen King is the author of too many bestselling books to name here, but some of our favorites include: <i>Cell</i>, <i>The Stand</i>, <i>On Writing</i>, <i>The Shining</i>, and the entire Dark Tower series. King also received the National Book Foundation 2003 Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters, has had many movies and television miniseries adapted from his novels, short stories, and screenplays, and is a regular columnist for <i>Entertainment Weekly</i>. Keep your eyes peeled for <i>Lisey's Story</i> (October 2006), a new television series on TNT based on <i>Nightmares &amp; Dreamscapes </i> (July 2007), and a graphic novel series based on the Dark Tower books coming from Marvel (2007). </b><br><br> When I heard that Scott Smith was publishing a new novel this summer, I felt the way I did when my kids came in an hour or two late from their weekend dates: a combination of welcoming relief (thank God you're back) mingled with exasperation and anger (where the hell have you been?). Well, it's only a book, you say, and maybe that's true, but Scott Smith is a singularly gifted writer, and it seems to me that the twelve years between his debut--the cult smash <i>A Simple Plan</i>--and his return this summer with <i>The Ruins</i> is cause for exasperation, if not outright anger. Certainly Smith, who has been invisible save for his Academy Award-nominated screenplay for the film version of <i>A Simple Plan</i>, will have some 'splainin to do about how he spent his summer vacation. Make that his last twelve summer vacations.<p> But enough. The new book is here, and the question devotees of <i>A Simple Plan</i> will want answered is whether or not this book generates anything like <i>Plan</i>'s harrowing suspense. The answer is yes. <i>The Ruins</i> is going to be America's literary shock-show this summer, doing for vacations in Mexico what Jaws did for beach weekends on Long Island. Is it as successful and fulfilling as a novel? The answer is not quite, but I can live with that, because it's riskier. There will be reviews of this book by critics who have little liking or understanding for popular fiction who'll dismiss it as nothing but a short story that has been bloated to novel length (I'm thinking of Michiko Kakutani, for instance, who microwaved Smith's first book). These critics, who steadfastly grant pop fiction no virtue but raw plot, will miss the dazzle of Smith's technique; <i>The Ruins</i> is the equivalent of a triple axel that just misses perfection because something's wrong with the final spin.</p><p> It's hard to say much about the book without giving away everything, because the thing is as simple and deadly as a leg-hold trap concealed in a drift of leaves...or, in this case, a mass of vines. You've got four young American tourists--Eric, Jeff, Amy, and Stacy--in Cancun. They make friends with a German named Mathias whose brother has gone off into the jungle with some archeologists. These five, plus a cheerful Greek with no English (but a plentiful supply of tequila), head up a jungle trail to find Mathias's brother...the archaeologists...and the ruins.</p><p> Well, two out of three ain't bad, according to the old saying, and in this case; what's waiting in the jungle isn't just bad, it's horrible. Most of <i>The Ruins</i>'s 300-plus pages is one long, screaming close-up of that horror. There's no let-up, not so much as a chapter-break where you can catch your breath. I felt that <i>The Ruins</i> did draw on a trifle, but I found Scott Smith's refusal to look away heroic, just as I did in A Simple Plan. It's the trappings of horror and suspense that will make the book a best seller, but its claim to literature lies in its unflinching naturalism. It's no <i>Heart of Darkness</i>, but at its suffocating, terrifying, claustrophobic best, it made me think of Frank Norris. Not a bad comparison, at that.</p><p> One only hopes Mr. Smith won't stay away so long next time.<i>--Stephen King</i> </p><br>What happens when one simple, innocent decision becomes a catastrophic mistake� <p>Craving an adventure on their Mexican holiday before they return home, a group of four friends impulsively set off in search of one of their own who has travelled to the interior to investigate an archaeological dig in the Mayan ruins. </p> <p>After a long journey into the heart of the jungle, the group come across trail.

Sarah of Do�re knows the pattern of spells is no accident. With each page, each powerful rune, she and Ruith are being led somewhere, to someone-but by whom, she cannot tell. Sarah&#39;s gift of sight only allows her to see the spells themselves, not the person behind them. A reluctant sorcerer still learning to trust his own magic, Ruithneadh of Ceangail knows he&#39;s woefully unprepared for the adversaries they&#39;ll face. But he and Sarah must collect and destroy his father Gair&#39;s spells soon. Many mages seek their power, and in the wrong hands, Gair&#39;s magic would plunge the Nine Kingdoms into an eternity of darkness. But as they pursue the final spells-acquiring strange companions, welcome allies, and unexpected foes along the way-Sarah and Ruith realize that their true quest has only just begun. The real enemy is closer, darker, and more power hungry than they ever imagined; and until he is defeated, the fate of the Nine Kingdoms hangs in dire peril.</p><p></p><h2>Just the Two of Us</h2><p>The lyrics of a Grammy winner&#39;s hit single are joined with stunning pencil and oil illustrations to celebrate the dignity, integrity, and honor of being a father. 125,000 first printing.</p><p>"Just the two of us, we can make it if we try.... Just the two of us, you and I."<p> If you were a radio-owner on planet Earth circa 1998, you might have a hard time not bobbing your head--and, yes, maybe even rapping--along with this book from Will "Big Willie Style" Smith and illustrator Kadir Nelson.</p><p> That's because the words for <i>Just the Two of Us</i> are lifted from the lyrics to Smith's smash-hit single of the same name, a remake of the Bill Withers classic. True to the song, this radiantly drawn picture book follows a father as he watches his son grow into a man. Tender imagery (especially for hip-hop) details the dad's early, unfamiliar struggles with everything from child car seats to CD-ROMs, his aspirations ("Sometimes I wonder what you're gonna be, a general, a doctor, maybe an MC"), his worries ("Ooh there ain't no pain like from the opposite sex"), and his attempts to impart wisdom ("Always tell the truth, say your prayers, hold doors, pull out chairs, easy on the swears").</p><p> Nelson, whose work has appeared in everything from <i>Sports Illustrated</i> to <i>The New Yorker</i>, seems an ideal foil for Smith's colloquial stylings, contributing rich, vibrantly colored spreads that evocatively capture the subject matter without being overly sentimental. A must for fans of Will Smith, especially "all the fathers out there holdin' it down" (to whom Smith gives "special props"). (Ages 4 to 8) <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p>A Conversation With Will Smith <p>Just The Two of Us celebrates the joy of fatherhood. What do you want your sons and daughter to learn from this book? </p><p>I want them to learn a few small gems of wisdom that I think are very important. For example, throughout life people will treat them badly and disrespect them but they must let God deal with those people. If they keep hate it will consume them. That is the concept I try to live my life by &#x2013; not to condemn people for their actions but to follow my own path to righteousness. I let God deal with the negativity that people bring towards me and I do not allow that negativity to be transferred because it can fester like a cancer. </p><p>You&#x2019;ve dedicated this book to your parents and to the memory of your grandmother. What was the biggest lesson you learned from them? </p><p>I learned the importance of dedication. I had people in my life who dedicated themselves to be parents. I think that parents provide the first impression of God their children experience. Mom and Dad are the measuring tool for the greatness that this world can be and the level of godliness that exists. So if a child&#x2019;s mother doesn&#x2019;t love them, it is hard for them to believe that anyone will love them. If their father is not there to protect them, it is hard for them to believe that anyone will protect them, even God. </p><p>What did you like best about creating a book for children? </p><p>Just The Two of Us is one of the best records I have ever written. The messages and the emotions in the record really lent themselves well to a children&#x2019;s book. Also, I think there was a certain feeling generated by the video that felt natural to recreate pictorially into the book Just The Two of Us. </p><p>What other books do you plan to write? </p><p>Jada and I have a few other ideas, but nothing we&#x2019;re ready to discuss at this point. We are keeping it hush, hush and working with the people at Scholastic to help flush out these ideas. </p><p>What books do you read to your children? </p><p>For the last two years it has been all Pokemon. Trey has about 40 Pokemon books that he reads every night. Jaden is pretty much into Cat in the Hat and so am I. </p><p>Did you have a favorite book as a child? </p><p>I was really into Amelia Bedelia. If I were to create a series of books they would be somewhere along the lines of the Amelia Bedelia series. </p><p>What advice would you give to aspiring writers, musicians and actors of today? </p><p>The most important advice is to be very honest with yourself about your ability. Then encourage everyone around you to be honest with you about your ability. If you are a little unsure, feel that you might be good, or just want to try it, it becomes a lot more difficult to summon the strength it takes to fight your way through this industry. So, you have to know from the start that you are great and you are going to win. Beyond that point the only advice is to do it because you love it, not because you want an award or you expect to make money. All the other accolades and financial blessings will come. </p><p>How has being a parent changed your views? </p><p>I don&#x2019;t think being a parent has changed my views as much as it has solidified my convictions. I was raised well by very strong and caring parents who laid a solid foundation. Then, as all kids do, I had my time to go out and experiment with everything that was completely the opposite of how I was raised. Eventually, I came back to the convictions of my childhood with the asphalt of my experiences and a dash of my own personal viewpoints of the world. Yet, for the most part I live by the foundation upon which I was raised. </p><p>You have a high-profile career, you&#x2019;re blessed with a beautiful and talented wife and children, and now you&#x2019;re venturing into children&#x2019;s books.

And as James Alexander Thom&#x2019;s extraordinary new novel reaches a shattering climax, the reader hurtles into a collision between true loyalty and true betrayal&#x2013;and between the best and basest reasons for war.<br><br>Narrated by two soldiers on opposite sides of the Mexican-American War of 1846, Saint Patrick&#x2019;s Battalion tells the true but little-known story of an Irish immigrant who deserted from the U.S. Army and was joined across enemy lines by hundreds of comrades. Driven by the abuses of Protestant West Point&#x2014;trained officers and the realization that they were attacking fellow Catholics, John Riley and his San Patricios abandoned their adopted country and took their place proudly alongside the dashing Hidalgo horsemen and stolid native Indians who were being used by the Mexican army as cannon fodder against the foreign invaders. Though hopelessly misled by the vainglorious Santa Ana, and facing such future military legends as a brooding young Ulysses S. Grant and the brilliant captain Robert E. Lee, Riley and his fighters were responsible for an enormous number of American casualties&#x2013;and would eventually pay a brutal price for their treachery.<br><br>Its narrative foreshadowing America&#x2019;s Civil War, Saint Patrick&#x2019;s Battalion asks haunting questions about American expansionism, racism, and the machinations of a war that began before it was declared. From horrific depictions of cannonade warfare to the quiet corners of doubt, courage, and love in men&#x2019;s hearts and minds, James Alexander Thom&#x2019;s novel takes us on an astounding adventure into beautiful, harsh Mexico&#x2013;and dramatically chronicles a crucial, bloody chapter in the making of America.</p><p>During the Mexican-American war, a group of mostly Irish and German Catholics deserted the American Army and fought for the Mexicans. Hated by the Americans as traitors and honored by Mexico as heroes, they were hanged as traitors for their actions.

The Berlin Noir Trilogy quickly established Kerr and Gunther as the perfect combination of writer, character, setting and genre. These gritty, noir thrillers, narrated in Gunther&#39;s wry, sardonic voice, range all over Europe and beyond. They span a 20-year period from the mid-30s to the mid-50s, covering the build up to World War 2, the war itself and finally its bitter aftermath. With impeccable research that is accurate in every detail yet never interferes with narrative pace, Philip Kerr has created an epic series of thrillers that deserve all the praise that has been heaped upon them. Prague Fatale is Bernie Gunther&#39;s eighth outing. Set in Prague in 1942, it delivers all the fast-paced and quick-witted action that we have come to expect from Philip Kerr. It is an outstanding thriller by a writer at the top of his game.</p><p>Philip Kerr is the author of seven other acclaimed Bernie Gunther novels.

Now, <i>The Purple Shroud</i> chronicles Theodora at the height of her power, bringing the ancient world alive in another unforgettable, epic saga.<p>Theodora and Justinian have been crowned Emperor and Empress, but ruling an empire is no easy task. The two factions of Christianity are still battling for dogmatic supremacy, the Empire's borders are not secure, and Theodora worries about the ambitions of Justinian's two best generals. But the most pressing concern is close to home: Constantinople's two factions, the Blues and the Greens, are beginning to unite in their unhappiness with rising taxes. When that unhappiness spills over into all-out violence, thousands are killed (including someone very close to Theodora) and many of the City's landmarks are destroyed, including Theodora's beloved Hagia Sophia. In the aftermath of the riots, Theodora guides Justinian in gaining back the love and trust of the people, her unerring instinct for what the people want proving invaluable. Justinian promises to rebuild the Hagia Sophia to be even more spectacular than before. Theodora comes to realize that being the Augusta is simply another role she must play, though the stakes are much higher and there is no offstage. It's a role she was born to play.</p></p><p><b>Stella Duffy</b> was born in London, grew up in New Zealand, and now lives in London.

Why did she throw out all of Clare's August Isle postcards? Why is Miranda so afraid of the sea? Who was Ben, a boy who apparently knew Clare and Miranda's mother when they were younger?

He was first apprenticed as a Mayan shaman and rose to become the First Chief of the village. On returning to the US, he began working in New Mexico as a medicine man. He is now an internationally recognized healer, speaker and artist, who writes frequently for journals and periodicals.Following up on Secrets of the Talking Jaguar and Long Life, Honey in the Heart, Prechtel closes his epic autobiographical trilogy by mixing Mayan myths with a first-person account of his efforts to escape from Guatemala with his family intact during the 1980s civil war that tore the country apart. The book opens with an extended rendering of a myth in which corn is introduced to Central America after a tumultuous romance between a human named Raggedy Boy and a goddess known as the Water-Skirted Beauty. Prechtel's own narrative is far less clear-cut-he begins by exploring the history of Santiago Atitlan, the village that is the setting for the myth, then delves into the political and religious repression he witnesses as a village resident. While this digressive style allows for a variety of perspectives to float within the narrative simultaneously, passages of elaborate, florid prose render the material uneven. While Prechtel's love for Guatemala and the people of Central America remains obvious throughout, most compelling is the suspense-filled section at book's end, where government troops arrive and threaten both Prechtel and his family before they can make their way to Los Angeles and then Prechtel's native New Mexico.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Shito-Ryu Karate</h2><p>Striking points, target areas, stances, hand, elbow and foot techniques, and methods of blocking are covered in this fully illustrated book on shito-ryu, one of the four major styles of Japanese karate.</p><p></p><h2>Shelter in Place (Thorndike Press Large Print Basic)</h2><p>From #1 New York Times bestselling author Nora Roberts comes Shelter in Place?a powerful tale of heart, heroism . . . and propulsive suspense.<br><br>It was a typical evening at a mall outside Portland, Maine.

She lives in New Jersey.<p></p><p><b>Chapter 1</b></p><p></p><p></p><p>Regardless of which decorative painting techinique you choose, color will be its most vital component. How the colors you pick look together, suit your space, and harmonize with the existing colors will greatly affect the success of any project. So before you start, take time to learn about color and its role in interior design.</p><p></p><p></p><p>First, be aware that no two people see color in the same way -- color is perhaps the most subjective area of design. Choosing colors that you enjoy seeing together is one of the best ways to make your house truly your own. Decorative painting, in particular, lets you fashion a vast array of colors notable for their richness, subtlety, and depth. They can give your rooms an individuality no paint-chart color can match.</p><p></p><p></p><p>In interior design, the colors you select must always be considered in relation to those around them. The way in which they are distributed throughout a room is called a <i>color scheme.</i></p><p></p><p></p><p>Deciding which colors to include in your scheme can be fun -- it lets you be creative. But like an artist faced with a blank canvas, you may initially be overwhelmed by the range of options. For help in determining combinations that work well together and bring out the best in your home, you can refer to established principles of interior design as well as guidelines for achieving a pleasing blend of hues.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Many of these rules appear on following pages. In reviewing them, however, bear in mind that, as with any rules, you'll find numerous exceptions. In fact, you could join any two colors in one setting, depending on how much area the hues will cover, how close together they will be, and whether they will be patterned or solid.</p><p></p><p></p><p>So, since the rules don't cover all contingencies, you must do something you may at first find challenging -- <i>trust your instincts.</i> How do the colors make you feel? Do you like them together? Are they the ones you want to live with? Rest assured that no design professional can answer these questions better than you, and have confidence that if a color pleases your eye, it has the best chance of looking "right" for your room.</p><p></p><p></p><p>UNDERSTANDING COLOR</p><p></p><p></p><p>Identifying successful color schemes is not as complicated as you may think. Remember, your instincts are probably right! One way to gain confidence is to review the basics of color theory.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Our earliest paint-box lessons still apply: Any hue can be made by combining the three primary colors -- red, yellow, and blue -- plus various amounts of black and white. By mixing pairs of primaries, you form the three secondary colors -- red and yellow make orange; yellow and blue make green; blue and red make violet. Then, by blending the secondaries, you'll get the tertiary colors -- olive, for instance, which comes from a mixture of green and violet.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Today, however, thanks to technology, we should probably qualify the basic rule to say that <i>almost</i> any color can be created from the primaries. In reality, the more colors you combine, the less vibrance the resulting hue will have. So manufacturers now produce a wide range of colors whose brilliance would be hard to match by starting with the primaries.</p><p></p><p></p><p>COLORS THAT HARMONIZE</p><p></p><p></p><p>To grasp the relationships among colors, you can use the <i>color wheel</i> pictured below. It has twelve parts, like the face of a clock. You'll find the primary colors at twelve o'clock (yellow), four o'clock (red), and eight o'clock (blue). The secondary colors are at two o'clock (orange), six o'clock (violet), and ten o'clock (green). In the remaining six spaces are the intermediate colors, so called because they lie between the primary and secondary colors.</p><p></p><p></p><p>From the position of colors on the wheel, you can identify harmonious blends. Among recommended combinations are <i>similar</i> colors, such as orange and yellow, which appear near each other on the wheel, and <i>complementaries,</i> such as red and green, which appear opposite each other. Complementaries serve a special purpose in decorating: They tone each other down to help balance a scheme.</p><p></p><p></p><p>A color also blends well with the colors flanking its complementary -- orange with either blue green or blue violet, for instance. This arrangement is called <i>split-complementary.</i> You'll also discover that <i>triads</i> -- any three colors equidistant on the wheel -- harmonize. Exemplifying this are the primary colors.</p><p></p><p></p><p>COLOR CHARACTERISTICS</p><p></p><p></p><p>Even though the categories mentioned above might be unfamiliar to you, you'll probably find that many of your favorite color combinations fit into them naturally. You may not recognize them at first, however, because on the color wheel they are in their "pure" form, and this is rarely the form in which they are used in decorating.</p><p></p><p></p><p>A color has three main characteristics: its <i>hue,</i> the color family to which it belongs; its <i>intensity,</i> how dull or vivid it is; and its <i>value,</i> how dark or light it is. By varying the intensity and value of the pure colors, we derive a multitude of others. For example, by altering the value of pure red, we can get both rose and pink, which belong to the same color family and thus share the same position on the color wheel.</p><p></p><p></p><p>To change the value of a color, mix black and/or white into it. Mixing a color with white creates a <i>tint;</i> combining it with black produces a <i>shade.</i> Blending it with gray makes a tone.</p><p></p><p></p><p>CLASSIC COLOR SCHEMES</p><p></p><p></p><p>Based on these principles, we can devise color schemes that are pleasing and easily achieved. Using different values of the same color -- mint, medium, and forest green, for instance -- will give you a <i>monochromatic</i> arrangement. The scheme can be enhanced by decorative painting's two-tone effects. Try, say, walls with a mint base coat and a medium green sponged glaze layer, for example, to add interest to a subdued setting.</p><p></p><p></p><p>You can also create a harmonious setting with different colors that have the same value: three pastels, for example. The contrast between, say, light peach, pale violet, and soft green enlivens the scene, while their similarity in value ties them together and prevents one color from dominating and throwing the scheme oft balance. Consider soft peach walls trimmed with a stenciled border in pale violet and light green.</p><p></p><p></p><p>You may not be used to thinking of color in terms of value; so identifying different colors with the same value may take practice. To get a feel for values, imagine looking at a black-and-white photograph of a room in your house -- or better yet, actually take a black-and-white photo of the room and study it. In the photo, all the colors that have the same value will be the same shade of gray. By diminishing the obvious differences in hues, you can more easily spot those of similar value.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Simplicity can be trusted when it comes to color schemes. Consider employing just a range of neutrals -- whites, beiges, grays, browns. You'll be surprised at how many of each there are, A subtle scheme like this maker a fine showcase for intricate painted finishes that might look busy in a brighter setting.</p><p>ard</p><p></p><p>Or you might link your favorite hue with white or a pale neutral, In fact, using your best color as an accent will produce a scheme that is notable for its versatility. If your taste changes, just switching the accent color will give your neutral scheme a new look. Employing a light accent with less contrast will imbue your setting with a relaxed air.</p><p></p><p></p><p>MORE COLOR-SCHEME OPTIONS</p><p></p><p></p><p>Interior designers have many methods for developing color schemes. A simple and effective one is to select the drapery or upholstery fabric first and then create a custom look by painting walls, woodwork, floors, and furnishings in coordinating hues.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Picking your fabric before you mix your paints is definitely safer. You can undoubtedly create a hue to match your fabric, but you might not as easily find a fabric to go with a distinctive color you've specially blended. Professionals usually advise that the background color of a print fabric and the base coat of your walls be the same.

This third volume publishes every single panel strip from 1955 and 1956 in one handsome and thick hardcover volume. Ketcham's legendary pen and ink work achieves its full flowering in this volume, as do the various situations and themes that Ketcham would return to: the first "split screen" (two-panel strip) that Ketcham would occasionally use; Dennis actually flirts with a girl; he rats Dad out to Mom; exacerbates confrontations between Dad and the police; and stymies hapless baby-sitters. Oh, and Mr. Wilson finally comes front-and-center as Dennis' #1 victim! <br></p><p>Hank Ketcham was born in 1920 and created Dennis the Menace in 1950. He passed away in 2001.The 1950s saw the apogee of the magazine gag cartoon, with dozens of skilled artists plying their trade in publications ranging from the <i>Saturday Evening Post</i> to <i>Playboy</i>. Ketcham's one-panel syndicated newspaper cartoons were as graphically adroit as any, but it wasn't his visual sophistication that kept <i>Dennis the Menace</i> on the comics page for half a century. Funny-pages readers aren't that artistically demanding. Rather, it was consistently sharp humor and the well-defined personalities of Dennis, his beleaguered parents, curmudgeonly neighbor Mr. Wilson, and the rest of the cast, who were never more engaging than in these early panels. <i>Gordon Flagg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Edgar Hoover&#39;s War Against Him</h2><p>By the end of 1934 Melvin Purvis was, besides President Roosevelt, the most famous man in America. Just thirtyone years old, he presided over the neophyte FBI's remarkable sweep of the great Public Enemies of the American Depression&#x2014;John Dillinger; Pretty Boy Floyd; Baby Face Nelson. America finally had its hero in the War on Crime, and the face of all the conquering G-Men belonged to Melvin Purvis. Yet these triumphs sowed the seeds of his eventual ruin. With each new capture, each new headline touting Purvis as the scourge of gangsters, one man's implacable resentment grew. J. Edgar Hoover, Director of the FBI, was immensely jealous of the agent who had been his friend and prot�g�, and vowed that Melvin Purvis would be brought down. A vendetta began that would not end even with Purvis's death. For more than three decades Hoover trampled Purvis's reputation, questioned his courage and competence, and tried to erase his name from all records of the FBI's greatest triumphs.<p> Alston Purvis is Melvin's only surviving son. With the benefit of a unique family archive of documents, new testimony from colleagues and friends of Melvin Purvis and witnesses to the events of 1934, he has produced a grippingly authentic new telling of the gangster era, seen from the perspective of the pursuers. By finally setting the record straight about his father, he sheds new light on what some might call Hoover's original sin - a personal vendetta that is one of the earliest and clearest examples of Hoover's bitter, destructive paranoia.</p></p><p><b>Alston Purvis</b> has appeared widely in the media, including the History Channel and A&amp;E, to talk about his father. He is head of Boston University's design department.<br><b>Alex Tresniowski</b> is a senior writer for People magazine specializing in politics, crime and current events. The author of five books, including an upcoming biography of boxer Billy Conn, he lives in New Jersey.Purvis's fascinating story of his father, once internationally famous for his role in the violent takedown of John Dillinger and now an obscure figure, limns a true American tragedy. The senior Purvis's meteoric rise to prominence at the FBI, just coming into its own, placed the genteel lawyer at the center of the war on crime that gripped the nation in the early 1930s. His enthusiasm and dedication caught the notice of FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, who promoted him repeatedly and gave him more and more serious responsibilities. But Hoover's pettiness and paranoia led him to turn on his prot�g�, even reaching out decades after Purvis's departure from the Bureau to block him from other jobs. The book's impact is lessened somewhat by florid writing ("Something evil came to Wellsville in the dead of night"). Purvis (with <i>People </i>magazine writer Tresniowski) could have compensated for the existence of rival narratives such as Bryan Burrough's definitive <i>Public Enemies</i> by dwelling more on his own memories of his father, rather than giving details of manhunts for gangsters, but he succeeds in giving Melvin Purvis the accolades he deserves.

When his father moves away to find work and his mother becomes ill, Danny struggles to help his family during the Great Depression.</p><p>No BioGrade 5-9-- New York City youngster Daniel Garvey is around 11 when the Depression begins. At first he doesn't notice it much, but as the years go by, he sees the toll first in his neighborhood, as friends' families are evicted, and then in his own family. His father, out of work, takes to the road to find employment, and Daniel is left in charge of his expecting, ailing mother and his baby sister. Things go from bad to worse, until the family is rescued by someone who, at first blush, appears to be worse off than they. This differs from Pieter Van Raven's A Time of Troubles (Scribners, 1990) in that it deals with an eastern metropolitan population, not migrant workers. Less derivative than Van Raven's book, it also presents a view of the Depression that, if no less desperate, is less bleak. Daniel is an engaging protagonist who goesthrough numerous rites of passage familiar to young teens--first girlfriend, shaving, and the sudden realization that he is taller than his mother. He must also come to terms with his father's death and mother's remarriage. If it all works out a trifle too smoothly, the story still imparts the flavor of the time, and the strong plot line and numerous interesting supporting characters will hold readers' attention. --Ann Welton, Univ .

Its buildings are made from mud, sticks or plastic, its entire economy is grey, and its citizens survive on rations and luck. Over the course of four years, Ben Rawlence became a first-hand witness to a strange and desperate limbo-land, getting to know many of those who have come there seeking sanctuary. Among them are Guled, a former child soldier who lives for football; Nisho, who scrapes an existence by pushing a wheelbarrow and dreaming of riches; Tawane, the indomitable youth leader; and schoolgirl Kheyro, whose future hangs upon her education.</p><p>In <i>City of Thorns</i>, Rawlence interweaves the stories of nine individuals to show what life is like in the camp and to sketch the wider political forces that keep the refugees trapped there. Rawlence combines intimate storytelling with broad socio-political investigative journalism, doing for Dadaab what Katherinee Boo's <i>Behind the Beautiful Forevers </i>did for the Mumbai slums. Lucid, vivid and illuminating, <i>City of Thorns</i> is an urgent human story with deep international repercussions, brought to life through the people who call Dadaab home.</p></p><p><p><b>BEN RAWLENCE</b> is a former researcher for Human Rights Watch in the horn of Africa.

And it is more than that. At a time when newspapers are filled with daily images of refugees arriving in boats on Europe&#x2019;s shores, when politicians and governments grapple with solutions to migration and erect ever larger walls and fences, it is an important reminder that a vast majority of the world&#x2019;s refugees never get as far as a boat or a border of the developed world.&#x201d;&#x2015;<i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><i></i><br>"[An] ambitious, morally urgent new book."<i>&#x2015;The New York Times </i><br><i></i><br>&#x201c;Magisterial....We see Dadaab through an accumulation of vivid impressions....[The book] moves like a thriller.&#x201d;&#x2015;<i>Los Angeles Times</i><br><i></i><br>&#x201c;The most absorbing book in recent memory about life in refugee camps...

Probably the most surprising two chapters are in what appears to be strictly a taxonomic review in Part III ('Economic Aspects'). These chapters on social and economic impact, and management give an applied view to a taxonomic tome and make it a very well-rounded volume for anyone interested in the field. The social and economic impacts are concisely, but dramatically, presented and well supported with photographs showing swarms of simuliids attacking livestock and poultry. The management chapter has a very helpful table that shows the control methods used against particular simuliid species in various locations.... Although recent trends tend to indicate the preference of digitally referenced materials over books, volumes are in many ways still indispensable at least at the current time.

Although such influential works as Moral Man and Immoral Society and The Nature and Destiny of Man are referred to mainly in passing, the essence of Niebuhr's liberal and social-activist philosophy--in particular his concern for Christianity's role in the public world--is revealed throughout. His correspondence with such friends as W. H. Auden, Felix Frankfurter and Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., and Ursula Niebuhr's introduction and linking material provide additional insights. While the moving final chapter ("Letters to a Dear But Departed Spouse") might have better served as an introduction to Reinhold's early years, this volume extends our knowledge of an important 20th-century thinker and his equally intelligent, appealing wife. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.This volume consists of letters by and to eminent American theologian Niebuhr (1892-1971), who taught at Union Theological Seminary and Harvard University. Edited by his wife Ursula--herself a trained theologian--the book provides significant insights into the personal and professional life of Niebuhr. A prolific writer on history, religion, and politics, he was also active in most of the significant liberal political and religious causes of his day, such as the Americans for Democratic Action and the World Council of Churches. The collection illuminates his convictions and love for his wife and children. Among the most interesting correspondence are exchanges between Niebuhr and historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. and jurist Felix Frankfurter. All theological collections will find this important.<br><i>- Susan A.

This newly issued paperback presents a sumptuously illustrated retelling of the lives of 18 women in the Hebrew Bible. Author Miki Raver pairs each vibrant and daring tale with an eloquent meditation on their meaning for modern women. Beautiful reproductions of classic Biblical art from such masters as Rubens, Brueghel, Raphael, and Chagall illustrate these dramatic stories. This rich marriage of art, literature, and spirituality offers substantive and entertaining reading, as well as a fresh entry into traditional faith. The perfect Chanukah or Bat Mitzvah gift, <i>Listen to Her Voice</i> is a book to treasure and share.</p><p>Miki Raver lectures about the women of the Hebrew Bible and leads women&#39;s circles dedicated to Shekhina, the female Divine presence.

Richly colored full-page paintings show a lovingly individualized Chicano family that is part of a New Mexico community in the open landscape under the starlit winter sky. Anaya's upbeat story, first published in a magazine in 1987, focuses on Luz, a young girl whose father, wounded in World War II, hasn't come home yet. Her sick grandfather is not strong enough to cut the logs for the traditional <i>luminarias</i> (small bonfires), so Luz and her Indian friend Reina from a nearby pueblo find a way to make <i>farolitos</i> (lighted candles in paper bags weighted with sand) to light the way for the Christmas pilgrims. The Spanish words are a natural part of the narrative (they're explained in a glossary at the back), and if the plot's contrived (Dad returns home just in time), the image of the path of light is touching and beautiful. <i>Hazel Rochman</i></p><h2>The Antinomies of Antonio Gramsci</h2><p><b>A major essay on the thought of the great Italian Marxist</b><br><br>Perry Anderson&#x2019;s essay &#x201c;The Antimonies of Antonio Gramsci,&#x201d; first published in <i>New Left Review</i> in 1976, was an explosive analysis of the central strategic concepts in the thought of the great Italian Marxist. Since then it has been the subject of book-length attacks across four decades for its disentangling of the hesitations and contradictions in Gramsci&#x2019;s highly original usage of such key dichotomies as East and West, domination and direction, hegemony and dictatorship, state and civil society, and war of position and war of movement.<br><br> In a critical tribute to the international richness of Gramsci&#x2019;s work, the essay shows how deeply embedded these notions were in the revolutionary debates in Tsarist Russia and Wilhelmine Germany. Here arguments crisscrossed between Plekhanov, Lenin, Kautsky, Luxemburg, Luk�cs and Trotsky, with later echoes in Brecht and Benjamin.<br><br> A new preface considers the objections the essay provoked and the reasons for them.

Monty Python's Flying Circus, an unheralded, previously unseen and practically unprogrammed half hour of sketches, hilarities, inanities and animations first appeared on the BBC late one night in 1969. Its impact on the world has been felt ever since.</p><p>From its humble beginnings as late night entertainment on a British TV channel that went off the air before midnight, it blossomed into arguably the most influential movement in modern comedy. They found the Holy Grail, they detailed the life of the Savior-also-ran Brian, and when we were lost, they explained The Meaning of Life.</p><p>Now, those purveyors of dead parrots and silly walks are going to tell us something more: Their story.

This is an oral history by the six members (Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, and Michael Palin) from birth to--in the case of Chapman--death. We get reminisces about childhood, university days, early successes, and rich details about the landmark <i>Flying Circus</i> TV series and subsequent films. The voices are fresh (with expectation of Michael Palin's insightful diary entries), not just complied from earlier publications. "Due to his insistence of being inconveniently dead," Chapham's voice is heard through his longtime partner David Sherlock, his brother and sister-in-law (and some archival materials). As a whole, the six impart a refreshing ability to deal honestly with the frustrations that arose over the years and it comes out in the text even when events are recalled differently. The book is not a light read (figuratively and literally), perhaps a smaller size would have been better for the amount of text; a cursory glance at the coffee table is tough. What does fill the book is an abundance of photos (over 1,000), most never published and many from the troupe's private collections. Along with concept sketches, Gilliam's drawings and doodles, and a few correspondences, this is a keepsake memento of the legendary group. <i>--Doug Thomas</i><p><b>Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones</b>, and <b>Michael Palin</b>, were all lifelong (so far) members of Monty Python.<br><b>Bob McCabe</b> is a writer.</p></p><h2>Julius Rosenwald: The Man Who Built Sears, Roebuck and Advanced the Cause of Black Education in the American South (Philanthropic and Nonprofit Studies)</h2><p><p>"This is the first serious biography of the exuberant man who transformed the Sears, Roebuck company into the country&#x2019;s most important retailer.

E. B. DuBois on Julius Rosenwald</p><p>In this richly revealing biography of a major, but little-known, American businessman and philanthropist, Peter Ascoli brings to life a portrait of Julius Rosenwald, the man and his work. The son of first-generation German Jewish immigrants, Julius Rosenwald, known to his friends as "JR," apprenticed for his uncles, who were major clothing manufacturers in New York City. It would be as a men&#x2019;s clothing salesperson that JR would make his fateful encounter with Sears, Roebuck and Company, which he eventually fashioned into the greatest mail order firm in the world. He also founded Chicago&#x2019;s Museum of Science and Industry. And in the American South Rosenwald helped support the building of the more than 5,300 schools that bore his name. Yet the charitable fund he created during World War I went out of existence in 1948 at his expressed wish. Ascoli provides a fascinating account of Rosenwald&#x2019;s meteoric rise in American business, but he also portrays a man devoted to family and with a desire to help his community that led to a lifelong devotion to philanthropy. He tells about Rosenwald&#x2019;s important philanthropic activities, especially those connected with the Rosenwald schools and Booker T. Washington, and later through the Rosenwald Fund.</p><p>Ascoli&#x2019;s account of Rosenwald is an inspiring story of hard work and success, and of giving back to the nation in which he prospered.</p></p><p>Named one of the 2006 &#34;Best Books of the Year&#34; by The Chicago Tribune<b>-- A <i>ForeWord</i> Magazine "Book of the Year" Finalist--</b></p><h2>Milkman&#39;s on His Way</h2><p>Book by Rees, David</p><p></p><h2>The Hatterasman (Lives in Place) (Lives in Place)</h2><p>Fifty years after its original hardcover publication, this anniversary edition features a new introduction by Philip Gerard and a biographical essay by Barbara Brannon.

A former detective inspector of the Amsterdam police, his fictional characters reflect the depth and personality of individuals encountered during his 38-year career in law enforcement. Baantjer holds the honor of being knighted by the Dutch monarchy."First published in 1987, this clever mystery in Baantjer's series featuring Inspector DeKok of the Amsterdam police's Warmoes Street station (DeKok and the Murder in Bronze, ect.) should help gain him new readers in the U.S. A distraught young man, Richard Neterwood, tells DeKok and DeKok's impetuous sidekick, Dick Vledder, that he took his girlfriend, Rosalind Evertsoord, to Slotervaart Hospital on a neurology referral from her doctor and she simply disappeared. Other young women have also gone missing at the respected hospital, which denies all knowledge of the women. DeKok must deal with a fatherly pimp, a skilled forger, angry boyfriends and devious hospital officials to unravel the case.

The novels are written in a simple, straightforward style, with excellent translation. DeKok (who always responds to his name: "er, as in kay oh kay" is an unusual character, and Amsterdam is presented with the full flavor of the city and its famous Red Light District.

The activists built a movement that helped to push the nation toward redemocratization. They joined with political allies in an effort to institute an ambitious slate of municipal reforms. Those measures ultimately fell short of aspirations, and soon the reformers were struggling to hold together a fraying coalition. Rio was bankrupted by natural disasters and hyperinflation and ravaged by drug wars. Well-armed drug traffickers had become the new lords of the favelas, protecting their turf through violence and patronage. By the early 1990s, the promise of the favela residents' mobilization of the late 1970s and early 1980s seemed out of reach. Yet the aspirations that fueled that mobilization have endured, and its legacy continues to shape favela politics in Rio de Janeiro.</p><p><p>Bryan McCann is Associate Professor of History at Georgetown University.

By consulting the index you will be referred to the page on which the term is defined, and possibly illustrated. </p><p> The stratigraphical column is given on page 328, and will be a particularly valuable reference for collectors of fossils. </p><p><b> How to collect in safety </b></p><p> Before setting out to collect it is most important to give thought to, and to take such precautions as would ensure, one's personal safety and preserve the interests of others. Excellent advice is given in Planning for Field Safety, a reference published by the American Geological Institute. All those who contemplate geological fieldwork are urged to obtain a safety guide and to follow its advice. </p><p> The basic equipment required to collect is a hammer, chisel, notebook and pencil, felt-tipped pen, wrapping materials and a bag. The usual geological hammer has a square head and a chisel edge, which is particularly useful for splitting rocks when looking for fossils. Do not be tempted to use any other kind of hammer. Geological hammers are specifically tempered and others are likely to splinter when hammering, and metal splinters could damage the eyes. A steel chisel is sometimes required to prize open rocks which resist hammering, or for carefully breaking specimens which might be damaged by blows from a hammer. When hammering be very careful indeed of flying splinters of rock. Protective goggles can be obtained and should always be worn. Specimens should be carefully numbered; use either a felt-tipped pen or tape on which a number can be written. The exact locality from which the specimens were collected should be recorded in the notebook. Specimens should always be wrapped in plenty of newspaper in order to prevent chipping or scratching, and small or delicate specimens are best carried in a small box, such as a match or cigar box. If a large collection is to be made, or if long distances are to be walked, then a stout backpack is the most suitable kind of bag to have. </p><p> The best places to collect minerals, rocks and fossils are usually quarries, cliffs, road cuttings and mine dumps, but any outcrop of rock may prove fruitful. It should be borne in mind that rock outcrops are potentially hazardous and appropriate protective clothing should be worn. In addition to the goggles mentioned above, a helmet of approved design gives protection against head injuries. It is usually mandatory to wear a helmet in quarries. Injuries can also result from rock falling on the feet. Boots, rather than runners, or other soft footwear should be worn in the field, and those with protective toecaps offer the best protection. Particular care is needed, however, when collecting near quarry faces or from the foot of cliffs, and permission must always be sought if it is intended to collect from outcrops on private land. An increasing number of sites in Britain are being designated as Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), and are protected by law. Collecting from these sites may be restricted or forbidden: it is necessary to check in advance. Remember to take care and precautions if you intend to do field work on your own, and always tell someone of your intended route before setting out. </p><p> Geological maps, sometimes on a large scale, are available for most parts of the world, and they show the distribution and geological ages of the different rock types. This information should indicate where fossils are likely to be found, and where it is probably best to look for minerals, or for interesting rock types. If there is a museum in your area, a visit may well be worthwhile. Many museums not only have exhibits illustrating the geology of their vicinity, but they also usually have displays of minerals, fossils, and sometimes rocks, which will help you to 'get your eye in', and give you some idea of what is to be found in your neighborhood. </p><p><b> Housing a collection </b></p><p> A collection is best kept in a cabinet of shallow drawers, with the specimens placed in individual cardboard trays. Under no circumstances should specimens be placed one on top of the other. Each specimen should have its own label giving details of what it is and where and when it was collected. A number should also be firmly glued to each specimen, and a corresponding entry made in a notebook, card index, or in a computer giving details such as name and locality, and any other relevant information. This additional entry is a safety precaution against accidental loss of, or damage to, the label attached to the specimen. </p><p> The system followed in this book will prove a helpful and useful guide in arranging specimens, though there are, of course, other systems which you may prefer to follow. Mineral specimens, in particular, look their best when they are clean. To remove loose dust and dirt first take off the label, then immerse tne specimen in clean water to which a little detergent has been added, and lightly scrub it with a soft brush. This should not be done, of course, with specimens which are soluble in water, or with very delicate material. </p><p><b> Further reading </b></p><p> Although in the introductory sections of this guide, outlines of the subjects of mineralogy, petrology (the study of rocks), and paleontology (the study of fossils) are given, it is obviously not possible in a single volume to do justice to these subjects. Although something like 600 specific types of mineral, rock and fossil are described in the following pages, there are many other types which, for reasons of space, cannot be included. To help readers who would like to widen their knowledge, a list of recommended books is given on page 329. It would also be useful to include a list of the available geological maps and guides of particular areas, but such a list, if it is to be comprehensive, would need to be very long indeed. To find such maps and guides we suggest that you enquire at your local library. </p><p> For the real enthusiast there is no substitute for joining a geological society. Most countries have such societies organized on a national basis, but there are also local societies which cater mainly for the enthusiastic amateur, and which often have geological libraries, and organize field excursions to good collecting localities. </p></p><h2>The Chocolate Bunny Brouhaha (Chocoholic Mystery)</h2><p><b>From the national bestselling author of <i>The Chocolate Falcon Fraud</i> comes an Easter candy caper featuring chocolatiers Lee Woodyard and her Aunt Nettie, and a killer who&#x2019;s hopping mad...</b><br> &nbsp;<br> The approach of Easter means a rush of business at TenHuis Chocolade, and Lee&nbsp; and her Aunt Nettie need all the help they can get to make their famous chocolate bunnies.

Now she&#x2019;s on the hunt to find out who it is...<br><br><b>Includes tasty chocolate trivia!&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>JoAnna Carl</b> is the pseudonym for a multipublished mystery writer. She is the national bestselling author of the Chocoholic Mysteries, including <i>The Chocolate Falcon Fraud</i> and <i>The Chocolate Clown Corpse</i>. She spent more than twenty-five years in the newspaper business as a reporter, feature writer, editor, and columnist. She holds a degree in journalism from the University of Oklahoma and also studied in the OU Professional Writing Program. She lives in Oklahoma but summers in Michigan.Chapter 1<br><br>I always think of it as the afternoon of the Birdsong invasion.<br><br>It began with someone pounding on our back door and ringing the doorbell at the same time. TenHuis Chocolade seemed to be shaking with the sounds.<br><br>"What on earth?" I stood up and moved toward the door. "Whoever is out there must have three hands. It would take more than two to pound and punch that hard in unison."<br><br>I flipped the lock and swung the door open. "What's the matter?"<br><br>Bunny Birdsong rushed in, nearly knocking me flat. She's short, and I'm tall, and the two of us managed to get all mixed up. Arms and legs were every which way. I felt like a marionette with tangled strings.<br><br>Bunny was in a panic. "Quick! Quick! Close the door!"<br><br>She freed herself from our knot, whirled around, and slammed the door hard. She locked the dead bolt. Then she leaned back against the metal surface, panting. Her spiked blond hair was standing up straight, and her gray eyes were as big as poker chips.<br><br>"Thank God you were there to let me in, Lee! I was so frightened."<br><br>I stared. "What were you scared of, Bunny?"<br><br>"It was that man again! The one with the ski mask! He followed me down the alley!"<br><br>"Let me have a look," I said. I took Bunny by the arms and moved her aside. Then I unlocked the door and took hold of the handle.<br><br>But before I could turn it, Bunny had shoved herself in front of me again. "Don't open it, Lee! I'm sure he's dangerous!"<br><br>I beckoned to Dolly Jolly, who was sitting at one of our break room tables, staring at our performance. Dolly joined me at the door, and I spoke to Bunny, trying to keep my voice calm. "It's okay."<br><br>Dolly is more than six feet tall, husky, with brilliant and bushy red hair. I'm just a shade under six feet myself, not thin, with blond hair. Side by side, the two of us can make a big impression.<br><br>"Dolly and I are each as big as Goliath and as tough as Godzilla," I said. "We can scare anybody away."<br><br>"No, no!" Bunny sounded terrified.<br><br>I pushed the door open, and Dolly and I both peered around it. Then we stepped outside and looked up and down the alley. It was a crisp, sunny winter day in west Michigan, and there was no one near the back door of the TenHuis Chocolade shop.<br><br>Dolly yelled, "Nobody there!"<br><br>Dolly has one social flaw. She can't speak in a normal tone of voice. Everything she says comes out in a shout.<br><br>"Bunny, I don't see a soul," I said.<br><br>Bunny still looked scared. She sank into a chair and covered her face with her hands. "I know I didn't imagine it."<br><br>"It was probably just some guy headed for the back door of the wine shop," I said. I tried to make my voice calm and soothing.<br><br>"I hope that's all it was," Bunny said. "I'm sorry. I didn't mean to cause any trouble."<br><br>She got to her feet, and her chair fell over behind her. She picked it up, knocking it into the edge of the table. The can of Diet Coke I'd been drinking teetered. I caught it. Then Bunny went toward the restroom, her head drooping and her feet dragging.<br><br>As soon as we heard the restroom exhaust fan start, Dolly spoke in the loud hiss that she used for a whisper. "I'm so sorry for that poor little thing." Then she moved closer to me. "But your aunt's right. She's got to go."<br><br>I nodded and gave a sigh that came up from my toes. "You're right," I said. "Darn it."<br><br>I'm business manager for TenHuis Chocolade. We produce and sell fabulously delicious bonbons, truffles, and molded chocolate.<br><br>My aunt and uncle, Nettie and Phil TenHuis, apprenticed in the chocolate business in Amsterdam forty years ago, then opened their shop in Warner Pier, Michigan, the most picturesque resort on Lake Michigan and their hometown. My uncle Phil died seven years ago, and three years later Aunt Nettie remarried, becoming Nettie TenHuis Jones when she tied the knot with Warner Pier's chief of police, Hogan Jones. She remains president and chief chocolatier at TenHuis.<br><br>I handle the money. I'm Lee McKinney Woodyard, from the Texas branch of the family, and I serve as business manager.<br><br>Because much of our operation is mail order, we employ people year-round. Many Warner Pier businesses are not able to do that. They focus on the tourist season, from Memorial Day to Labor Day. But TenHuis keeps making truffles and bonbons all winter, fall, and spring. We're not a large operation; we have around thirty-five employees.<br><br>And Aunt Nettie refuses to fire a single one of them.<br><br>That doesn't mean that TenHuis Chocolade never has an employee who simply does not work out and has to be let go. No, it means that the job of firing people falls to the business manager. I have to do it.<br><br>And yes, I hate firing people just as much as Aunt Nettie does. But she's president and sole owner of the company. The Boss. Besides, I owe my dear aunt more than I can ever repay. Twice in my life-when I was sixteen, and my parents got a divorce, and when I was twenty-seven, and I got one myself-she took me in and told me I was going to get through the heartbreak. I love and respect her to the nth degree. I do what she tells me to do.<br><br>So if she says, "Take care of it, Lee." I say, "Yes, Aunt Nettie," even if I have to fire somebody. But I don't have to like it.<br><br>As if there wasn't enough going on already, I told myself. The regular responsibilities of my job included keeping the accounts, paying the taxes, sending out the bills, supervising our retail shop, ordering supplies, and a million other details. Plus, we were in the middle of preparing for Easter, a major marketing effort for the chocolate business, and my computer had picked this time to act up.<br><br>But the biggest problem was that we had launched a remodeling project that was going to double the size of our physical plant. We had bought the building next door, and we were starting the process of adding it to our current building.<br><br>The project, of course, was going to require at least twice as much time and twice as much money as we had anticipated. Everybody who had ever been through an expansion project like ours had warned me that would be true. Naturally I hadn't believed them until I was up to my hips in architects.<br><br>So I didn't have time to take the bad guy role and fire people. But in the case of Bunny Birdsong, it had to be done that day. Whether I wanted to do it or not.<br><br>I considered slashing my wrists. Then I pictured Aunt Nettie's reaction. "Lee, before you go to the hospital to be sewn up, would you please tell Bunny that we're letting her go? While you take care of that, I'll call an ambulance. And try not to bleed into the white chocolate vat."<br><br>I couldn't get out of it.<br><br>So when Bunny came out of the restroom, I spoke. "Bunny, as soon as you sign in, please come up to my office for a few min- utes."<br><br>Bunny nodded, though her head drooped even lower. My head was drooping just the same way as I walked up front and sat down behind my desk.<br><br>This is not a rehab facility, I told myself. This is a business. Our employees must be productive. If they aren't, then we must replace them. We are not a charity. Our purpose is to make a profit. It's the American way.<br><br>Darn it! And darn Joe Woodyard, too! I included my husband in the curse because he had recommended Bunny to us in the first place.<br><br>Bunny Birdsong had had a rough time in life. She needed a break for once, and Aunt Nettie and I had hoped we could give her one. But Bunny just hadn't worked out in the chocolate business, even at an entry-level job.<br><br>Some people think that low-level workers are dumb or unambitious or lazy or incompetent. That attitude makes me furious. Maybe it's because I come from a blue-collar family, but I have the highest respect for the people who do routine jobs.<br><br>I call the ladies who work for TenHuis our "geniuses." They must have great coordination; how many people can swirl a hundred tiny chocolate loops on top of a hundred bonbons and have the hundredth one be as even as the first? How many people can roll a half ounce of nougat into a ball that will become the filling for a truffle, do it two hundred times, and have every single ball be exactly the same weight as all the others? Yes, it's routine work. But it's also highly skilled. And yes, we pay above minimum, and we offer all the benefits we can afford.<br><br>But after three months at TenHuis Chocolade, Bunny just wasn't cutting it. Her bonbon decorations were messy. Her truffle production was slow, because she still weighed every single ball of nougat. She had once filled a bowl with milk chocolate and left a trail across the workroom floor when she carried it to the table where she was going to work. And then she stepped in her trail, slipped, and fell down. She could scrub the enrober-a sort of shower bath for truffles and bonbons-until it was spotless, but she could never remember how to reassemble it. After three months, she still required constant supervision.<br><br>Then there was this business of being afraid, of thinking someone was trying to hurt her. Bunny was continually fearful. If she got a phone call, there was a weirdo on the line. Her mail was full of crank letters. Or, like today, if she walked down the alley, a strange man followed her.<br><br>Yet I liked Bunny. She was sweet. She brought cupcakes-homemade and decorated crookedly-for the break room. She was cheerful, even when things were going askew. She told jokes-silly ones, but endearing. She was interested in her fellow workers. She was kind, and she never gossiped.<br><br>She was lovable, but she didn't produce chocolates. All I would be able to do was give her an extra month's salary and promise her a good recommendation.<br><br>Darn it again, I thought. Why does life have to be full of bad choices? Bunny's jerk of a husband was divorcing her. She had suddenly faced life without financial support, and now I had to tell her she couldn't handle a routine job making chocolates.<br><br>There was no good way to resolve this problem.<br><br>My office is in the front of the business so I can oversee the retail shop while I'm working. By the time I was at my desk, I was fit to be tied. So when the phone rang, it didn't help. Especially when the phone call came from one of our more demanding clients.<br><br>Stella Drumm is a chief buyer for a major department store chain. She spends a lot of money with us, and she expects a lot of service.<br><br>"Lee, I sent you an e-mail yesterday," she said angrily. "Why haven't you answered me?"<br><br>"I'm sorry, Stella. I haven't seen an e-mail from you. Can you send me a copy?"<br><br>"Never mind. We need to order six thousand eight-inch Easter bunnies in time for a promotion beginning March first. Will that be a problem?"<br><br>"Of course not, Stella." Six thousand! I'd get 'em there if I had to make every one myself. An order like that would pay for a lot of electricity and heat.<br><br>Stella kept talking. "We want the standard Easter colors, of course. Which reminds me, I hope the colors on your Web page aren't the real colors. Those are lousy. Too harsh. They look like a discount store."<br><br>"You're right, Stella. The colors didn't come out well on the Web page. My computer guy is supposed to fix them. I guarantee that the actual bunnies will be decorated with soft pastels."<br><br>"They'd better be, or they'll be shipped back to you. Collect. And we want the bunnies divided between the ones with baskets, the ones with wheelbarrows, and the farm boy bunnies with rakes and shovels. Have you got that?"<br><br>Yikes, that was going to require a lot of hand decorating, which meant overtime. We could turn the molds-reuse them-only once an hour. I'd have to beg my buddy at the mold company for extras, and they'd have to be sent overnight.<br><br>I figured rapidly. "You said two thousand of each?"<br><br>"No! We're putting them in a hundred stores. That would be six thousand!"<br><br>"Isn't that what you said?"<br><br>"No! It's three thousand of each, Lee. Nine thousand."<br><br>"I'm sorry I misunderstood." That wasn't what she had said, but for an order that size, I could grovel.<br><br>I repeated the order back to her, and she okayed it. She was still snappy, but somewhat mollified.<br><br>"I'll send you confirmation immediately," I said. "But I'm concerned because I didn't get your e-mail."<br><br>"I sent it through your Web site."<br><br>"Oh. We've had some trouble with the Web site. Do you have my regular e-mail?"<br><br>Stella and I double-checked to make sure we each had the proper e-mail address. "It's easier to use the Web site," she said.<br><br>"I know it is, and I'm going to call the tech immediately to make sure it's working right. If you're having problems, other people may be, too. It gives me the shudders."<br><br>We hung up, and I spoke firmly to the computer. "You'd better not cause any problems this Easter," I said. "I have a large mallet in the storeroom with your name on it."<br><br>Someone chuckled. I looked up and saw Bunny standing in the doorway. She had added a regulation food-service hairnet since we'd talked earlier. It was crooked, of course.<br><br>"Computers are not intimidated by force," she said. "What's this one doing?"<br><br>"I've had three cases when people sent me messages through the Web site, and I didn't get them. And our colors aren't true on the Web site."<br><br>"That may be your program. What are you using?"<br><br>Our conversation grew technical, and immediately I was in over my head. Bunny, however, spoke confidently, advising me to get a new computer program and specifying which one should work. She even sat down at my computer, improved the Web site colors, and tweaked the e-mail function. By the time she got up, I was ready to hug her.<br><br>"Bunny! That's great! Why didn't you tell me you knew computer grape juice! I mean, graphics! I didn't know you knew computer graphics."</p><h2>Between Lovers</h2><p>A Los Angeles-based writer still trying to get over being dumped seven years earlier by his former fiancTe, Nicole, who fell in love with another woman, unexpectedly finds himself caught in an intricate love triangle when Nicole suddenly comes back into his life, reopening feelings of anger, hurt, and unforgettable passion. 150,000 first printing.</p><p>ERIC JEROME DICKEY is the<i> New York Times</i> bestselling author of more than twenty novels, as well as a six-issue miniseries of graphic novels featuring Storm (<i>X-Men</i>) and the Black Panther. Originally from Memphis, Dickey now lives on the road and rests in whatever hotel will have him.<b> Chapter Two </b> <p> Nicole says, "I still want you to meet her." </p><p> I don't respond to that. </p><p> I lay there in the bed with my eyes closed. Nicole is on top of me, her hands tracing over my body, wide awake like she's been IV'ed to a double latte mocha cappuccino espresso. </p><p> Another commuter train rumbles by out on Embarcadero. </p><p> She kisses my lips before she heads for the bathroom. Nicole walks in a way that lets you know she used to do ballet many moons ago, as a child, that she does yoga as an adult, using the core of her body to move herself, her abs and inner thighs tight from doing most of the work. </p><p> Nicole leaves the bathroom door wide open. She sings a Pru song, the one about the candles. She sings that all the time. Her singing is terrible, but it has raw passion. The toilet flushes. </p><p> The sandman sprinkles sleep dust all over me. Try to shake it off. Body heavy. </p><p> Water runs in the sink. She's washing up. Her bracelets jingle with her scrubbing. </p><p> She asks, "Did you hear me when I said that I want you two to meet?" </p><p> I sit up. We stare. I tell her, "I'm not deaf." </p><p> "Last month, when I asked, you said that you'd think about it." </p><p> "Help me out here. Why would you want us to meet?" </p><p> "Then I won't feel guilty. Like I'm cheating." </p><p> "Are you?" </p><p> She pauses. "Then you won't act like she doesn't exist. I love you. I love her." </p><p> "You don't love her." </p><p> "How do you know?" </p><p> I say, "Adam and Eve. Adam and Eve." </p><p> We stare at each other, restless, indeterminate gazes that reach deep. </p><p> She says, "I'm a divided soul, sweetie. And I can't go on like this. Not much longer." </p><p> "Then choose." </p><p> This is a discussion we've had countless times since the wedding. Each time it becomes harder. </p><p> She tells me, "I have a solution. If you're still open to new things, it can work." </p><p> She wants me to ask, but I don't. </p><p> With a wounded smile, she hand-combs her locks, untangles that hairstyle that started off as a sign of resistance, and still is, and she takes my running shoes from the closet, tosses them at my feet. </p><p> She gently says, "Get dressed." </p><p> Fog walks the streets. Dark skies give Oaktown that Seattle appeal. </p><p> I have on black running tights, white T-shirt, gray St. Patrick's Day 10K sweatshirt. She wears blue tights and a black hooded sweat top, a red scarf over her golden hair. </p><p> We take a slow jog out of the Waterfront, by all the gift shops, head through the light fog. Rows of warehouses that are being converted into lofts line the streets. All in the name of profit and gentrification, the reversal of the White Flight is in progress. The homeless are out peddling Street Spirit papers for a buck a pop. Some are sleeping on the oil-stained pavement while people pass by in super-size SUVs and foreign cars that cost more than a house in the 'burbs of Atlanta, Georgia. The dirt poor, the filthy rich, all live a paper cup away from each other in the land of perpetual oxymorons. </p><p> I say, "You want me to meet this chick-" </p><p> "Don't say chick. That's a misogynistic word." </p><p> "Nicer than what I usually call her." </p><p> </p><p> "Which is disrespectful. Yeah, I think meeting will benefit us all." </p><p> "So, this thing with her is pretty serious?" </p><p> She smiles because I've given up the silent treatment. "It's serious. There's more to it." </p><p> Acid swirls in my belly. </p><p> Nicole goes on, "I think we can resolve this situation." </p><p> "More like what?" I ask. "What more is there?" </p><p> "We ... just more." She has a look that tells me this is deeper than it seems, but can't tell me all, not right now. She says, "Let's talk while we run." </p><p> We take the incline up Broadway, my mind trying to react to what she just asked me about meeting her soft-legged lover, whirring and clicking and whirring as we jog by the probation department. We come up on a red light and stretch some more while we wait for it to change. The signal makes a coo-coo, coo-coo, coo-coo sound when it changes to green, that good old audio signal for the blind folks heading north and south. It chirps like a sweet bird going east and west, so we know we have the right-of-way and it's okay to get back to running north toward freedom. </p><p> Before we make a step, a Soul Train of impatient drivers almost mows us down. </p><p> We jump back. Both of us almost get hit. That lets me know that both of our minds are elsewhere. </p><p> Nicole says, "Be careful here, sweetie. This is where all the assholes rush to get on the Tube." </p><p> Someone driving a black car with a rainbow flag in its window slows and allows us to cross. </p><p> I run behind Nicole. Check out the fluid movement of her thighs. Seven years ago they weren't so firm. Back then she had a whacked Atlantic Star hairdo that hung over one eye and she looked like Janet Jackson, not the Velvet Rope version, but the chubby-faced Penny on Good Times version. Now her belly is flat and the muscles in her calves rise and fall, lines in her hamstrings appear, her butt tightens; all of that shows how much she's been running, doing aerobics, hiking up every hill she can find. </p><p> It fucks with me. I try not to, don't want to, but it fucks with me and I can't help thinking about her being naked with another woman. Keep thinking about all the videos I've seen with women serving women satisfaction, but refuse to see Nicole in that light, in that life. I want to believe that they sit around baking cookies, knitting sweaters, and watching Lifetime Television for Women. </p><p> Those silver bracelets jingle as she gets a little ahead of me, not much. My shoes crunch potato chip bags and golden leaves. Buses spit black clouds of carbon monoxide in our faces. </p><p> The light at 13th catches Nicole. I catch up and ask, "Why does she want to meet me?" </p><p> "Because. Curious, I guess. I love you; she knows that. Sometimes she sounds intimidated." </p><p> "Because I'm a man." </p><p> "Maybe. After seven years, we have a solid history, don't you think?" </p><p> That makes me feel good. The simple, five-letter word solid makes me feel good. The signal coo-coos three times. We run north. </p><p> We race the incline toward Telegraph, a liquor store-lined street that leads into good old Berkeley. </p><p> At 20th, under the shadows of a sky-high Sears and World Savings building, she turns right toward Snow Park. We avoid a million chain-smokers who are congregated out in front of Lake Merritt Plaza, the black-lunged outcasts of a politically correct world, then cross several lanes of fast-paced traffic and head toward the children's park and petting zoo called Fairy Land. </p><p> I maintain a steady pace and ask, "This hooking up, is this for her, or for you?" </p><p> "For me. Because I'm in fucking purgatory." </p><p> </p><p> "Where do you think I am? I'm standing next to you." </p><p> "Feels like I'm dancing naked on the sun." </p><p> "That sounds painful." </p><p> "Wanna see my blisters?" She clears her throat, spits. "It's important for her because she needs to get comfortable with my needs, and wants, with my love for you, to be secure. And it's for you." </p><p> "How in the hell is this hooking up for me?" </p><p> "Because I see how much it hurts you. You're an open book." </p><p> "Don't go clich? on me." </p><p> "You put it in all of your books. Especially the one with the orange cover. The one where you wrote about the wedding." </p><p> "A fictional wedding." </p><p> "Save that bullshit for your fans. I read your books and I see me, hear the things I've said, see you, your words, hear your voice, feel sad and bad because I know that all the pain you write about is us." </p><p> "Maybe you should write a book. Let me know how you really feel, what's going on with you." </p><p> She goes on, "Be honest. Would you be this, I don't know, well, for lack of a better word, understanding if I were-" </p><p> "I'm not understanding; I don't understand this whole lesbian shit." </p><p> "I'm not a lesbian," she says with force.

In later years, she became famous for coming out on a national stage, working with two major organizations toward LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) rights and publishing two books. And just within the past eighteen months, Chaz Bono has entered the public consciousness as the most high-profile transgender person ever. <br><br> All through the hoopla surrounding his change, Chaz has insisted on maintaining his privacy. Now, in <i>Transition</i>, Chaz finally tells his story. Part One traces his decision to transition, beginning in his childhood-when he played on the boys' teams and wore boys' clothing whenever possible-and going through his painful, but ultimately joyful, coming out in his twenties, up to 2008, when, after the death of his father, drug addiction, and five years of sobriety, Chaz was finally ready to begin the process of changing his gender. In Part Two, he offers an unprecedented record in words and photographs of the actual transition, a real-time diary as he navigates uncharted waters. These chapters capture the day-to-day momentum of his life as his body changes. <br><br> Throughout the book, Chaz touches on themes of identity, gender, and sexuality; parents and children; and how harboring secrets shatters the soul. It is an amazing contribution to our understanding of a much- misunderstood community.<br><br>Listen to an Interview<p> </p></p><p><b>Chaz Bono</b> lives with his partner in Los Angeles.I experienced another incredible moment of clarity about myself. I understood for the first time that I couldn&#39;t focus on how others were going to react if I transitioned. I could not possibly control their reactions, their feelings, or their behaviors toward me. I had been so consumed with not upsetting anyone, but I could not continue deferring my own needs. Now I accepted that these people were all adults. It wasn&#39;t my job to make them okay; they had to make themselves okay with me. Which meant that the only person really in my way was myself.</p><h2>The Natural Order of Things</h2><p><i>The Natural Order of Things</i> is a tale of two families and the secrets that bind them. The voices of&nbsp;Antunes' characters -- an army officer being tortured in prison on charges of conspiracy; an elderly man, once a miner in Mozambique, now reduced to dreams of "flying underground"; a diabetic teenage girl and the middle-aged husband she despises; the officer's illegitimate sister, locked away to haunt the house like Bertha Rochester in Jane Eyre -- create a portrait of a disintegrating Portugal, a personal political history that attains the brilliance and surreality of Elias Canetti and Nikolai Gogol.</p><p>Using the poetic resources of language, and hinging his plot less on everyday logic than on a dreamlike progression from character to metaphor to history, Antunes's fantastically complex and compressed novel illumines Portugal's crime-studded history in this century. An unnamed 50ish clerk in the National Tourism office falls in love with Yolanda, a diabetic teenager living with her crazy father, Domingos Oliveira, and her aunt, Dona Orquidea, in Hyacinth Park, a working-class district of Lisbon. Yolanda is scornful of the clerk, but allows him to sleep with her. A writer (perhaps of the novel) hires an ex-secret policeman, Ernesto Portas, to find out anything he can about the man, and the information Portas collects becomes part of the narrative. Ever since the oppressive regime established by Antonio de Oliveira Salazar was overthrown in the mid-'70s, Portas has supported himself by running a correspondence course in hypnotism. His fantasy--that his hypnotic technique allows people to fly--matches Oliveira's fantasy, which is about flying underground in long dark mine shafts. Oliveira once worked in the mines in South Africa, and Yolanda was born in Mozambique. Her mother remains there still, in an insane asylum. The unnamed clerk is less certain about his past. His mother, Julieta, was locked up in the attic of the family house because she was a bastard, as is the clerk. His uncle Jorge Valadas was a military conspirator against the Salazar government. Episodes of Valadas's imprisonment and torture dominate the middle section of the novel. In the end, the unnamed clerk disappears, flying away like one of Portas's hypnosis students. The novel progresses through a series of monologues by the principal characters, mixing fantasy and fact in lyrical, impressionistic prose. It powerfully demonstrates the distortions inflicted upon history by secrecy and repression when, as in the Portugal of the '50s, brutality is sovereign. (Feb.) <br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.Antunes (b. 1942), who was trained as a psychiatrist and who spent four years in the Portuguese army during the Angolan War, characteristically interprets the stagnation of modern Portugual. His themes are reminiscent of Faulkner's and C?line's, and his style is as complex as Proust's. This novel, originally published in 1992, is a layered composite of several individuals and the secrets that bind them. First, there is the middle-aged man who lost his security job doing stakeouts and wiretapping once Portugal switched to democracy. He is shacked up with a diabetic girl young enough to be his granddaughter whom he loves madly while she fantasizes about younger men on motorbikes who will whisk her away from him. Their story is intertwined with that of an elderly man, once a miner in South Africa, who dreams pathetically of "flying underground," and that of an army officer, haunted by memories of prison torture, and his illegitimate sister, locked away like Rochester's wife in Jane Eyre. The work, a veritable assault on the past, manages to soar above the trivial toward allegorical relevance.

On cloudless mornings after a norther has blown through, the sky is such a perfect cobalt blue that you forget the "between" and know that heaven is Texas, or Texas is heaven&#x2014;it doesn't really matter which. But most days there are clouds between Texas and heaven&#x2014;puffy white clouds that set us dreaming on lazy summer days or roiling storm clouds that unleash lightning, tornadoes, and hail. The sky between heaven and Texas is a stage for drama more often than not, just like the lives we live below it. Perhaps that's why we're always looking up.</p> <p>In this beautiful book, noted photographer Wyman Meinzer revisits the place that inspires his most creative work&#x2014;the Texas sky. His photographs capture the vast dramas that occur between heaven and Texas&#x2014;rainstorms that blot out mountain ranges, lightning strikes that dazzle a night-black prairie, trains of clouds that rumble for miles over wheat fields, sunsets that lave the whole wide sky in crimson, gold, and pink. Meinzer's striking images reveal that in the sky above, no less than on the land below, endless variety is commonplace in Texas.</p> <p>Joining Meinzer in this celebration of the Texas sky are two fine writers, Sarah Bird and Naomi Shihab Nye. In her wonderfully personal introduction, Sarah Bird describes growing up as a dedicated cloud-watcher who, after several years among the cotton candy clouds and cool fogs of Japan, was shocked and exhilarated by the limitless hot skies of Texas. Naomi Nye has chosen poems by twenty-six Texas poets, including herself, which explore a spectrum of emotion about the sky above Texas and the weather in our lives beneath it. Together, photographs, memoir, and poems create a lasting connection with the power and presence of what Meinzer calls "that vast frontier and ocean above"&#x2014;the sky between heaven and Texas.</p></p><p>Wyman Meinzer, of Benjamin, Texas, has published numerous books of photographs of Texas, including Texas Sky, Texas Hill Country, and Texas Rivers. He has the distinction of having been named Texas State Photographer by the Texas Legislature. Meinzer's work appears in magazines nationwide; he is also a frequent contributor to Texas Highways and Texas Parks &amp; Wildlife.<br><br>Sarah Bird, of Austin, is an acclaimed novelist whose books include The Yokota Officers Club, Virgin of the Rodeo, The Mommy Club, The Boyfriend School, and Alamo House. Her sixth novel, The Flamenco Academy, will be published by Knopf in the spring of 2006. She also writes a column for Texas Monthly.<br><br>Naomi Shihab Nye of San Antonio, is an award-winning poet and educator who has served as a visiting writer all over the world. Her book 19 Varieties of Gazelle: Poems of the Middle East was a National Book Award finalist in 2002.</p><h2>Carrot Seed</h2><p>Despite everyone&#39;s dire predictions, a little boy has faith in the carrot seed he plants.</p><p>Ruth Krauss, author of <i>A Hole Is to Dig</i>, has crafted a story almost Zen-like in its simplicity. A little boy plants a carrot seed and waits patiently, tending to it carefully, while everyone around him insists that "it won't come up." His conviction is steadfast, however, and sure enough, a carrot worthy of first prize at any state fair springs forth from the earth. Krauss's husband, Crockett Johnson (creator of <i>Harold and the Purple Crayon</i>), illustrated <i>The Carrot Seed</i>, and while the little boy is rendered with uncomplicated lines, all of his hope, confidence, and serenity shine through. The image that resonates most strongly in this minimalist tale is the unfaltering faith of the mild-mannered little boy. Young readers learn that standing your ground in the face of opposition and doubt can often result in twice the reward expected (even thrice the reward, if judging by the girth of this carrot). <i>(Ages 4 to 8)</i><p>When you are very young,<br>there are some things that you just know....<br></p><p>This treasured story of childhood faith<br>rewarded is now avaliable in a board book<br>edition for the youngest child.</p></p><h2>Into the Storm: A Study in Command (Commander Series)</h2><p>&nbsp; In his brilliant, bestselling novels, Tom Clancy has explored the most timely military and security issues of our generation. Now he takes readers deep into the operational art of war with this insightful look at one of the greatest American military triumphs since World War II: the Gulf War.</p><p>Tom Clancy&#39;s latest love-letter to the military-industrial complex focuses on the Army--and Fred Franks, a general who helped smash Iraq in the Gulf War. In this first volume of a series on the intricacies of military command, Clancy traces the organizational success story of the U.S. Army&#39;s rise from the slough of Vietnam to the heights of victory in the Persian Gulf. In 1972, the Army lacked proper discipline, training, weapons, and doctrine; all these would be overhauled in the next 15 years. For those readers keen on such nuts and bolts, the book will be fascinating. But the book truly sparkles when Franks tells his story. A &#34;tanker&#34; who lost a foot in the invasion of Cambodia, he is a man of great courage, thoughtfulness, and integrity. One cannot help but wince when a civilian tells him, &#34;You and those boys did that for nothing.&#34; And for all the acronyms and military history, that is what this book is about: healing the wounds Vietnam inflicted. &#34;But this time [the Gulf War], it was going to end differently. They all would see to that.&#34;Tom Clancy has explored the military and security issues of our time in a brilliant series of novels. Now he takes us into the heart and mind of a remarkable military leader to show us the nature of war and command from the inside. <p>Based on the story of America's greatest military triumph since World War II -- the victory over Iraq in the Gulf War -- <i>Into the Storm</i> tells us how leaders learn and grow, and how they forge people, elements and forces together into a campaign of power and precision. We hear how General Frederick M. Franks, Jr. commanded the armor and infantry of VII Corps, the main coalition force that broke the back of Iraq's Republican Guard. Beyond that, <i>Into the Storm</i> describes the transformation of an army traumatized by the Vietnam War and the metamorphosis of a man devastated by the loss of a leg in that war. The former once again became the world's most powerful force; the latter, the first amputee active-duty general since the Civil War. </p><p>Together the story of that army, that man, and the war they fought make <i>Into the Storm</i> an instant classic of military history.</p></p><h2>Loompanics&#39; Greatest Hits: Articles and Features from the Best Book Catalog in the World</h2><p>Used.

This is the book she wanted--arranged by concepts, not alphabetically. It is organized in six chapters: "Deep Space," "Our Solar System," "Reaching and Maneuvering in Space," "Human Spaceflight," "Earth Science and Commerce from Space," and "Military and Intelligence Uses of Space." Each chapter is written and edited by a specialist in the field and divided into subchapters that average five pages in length and are in turn broken down into smaller entries. Special essays provide more in-depth information. For example, "The Great Crash of 1994,"<i> </i>addressing a huge asteroid that crashed into Jupiter, appears in the section on comets in the "Deep Space" chapter. Explanations are clear and basic, written for the popular audience. There are numerous charts, graphs, and time lines throughout. All measurements use the metric system. Words in bold type cross-reference other entries and subentries.<p>The appendix consists of double-page maps of the northern sky and the southern sky star charts with constellations, the moon, Mars, the solar system, the Milky Way, and the universe. In addition, the encyclopedia has more than 200 wonderful color pictures from NASA, the Hubble telescope, and satellite images, many of them covering a full page or a double-page spread.

Stuffed with dizzying leaps from character to character, from street protests to swanky soirees, and from lengthy uninterrupted interior monologues to rapid-fire dialogues, the novel also includes some wonderful long sentences." <strong><em>&#x2015;Publishers Weekly</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;The Ecuadorian writer has delivered his debut, The Revolutionaries Try Again. While it is, indeed, very much a novel rather than a political manifesto&#x2015;it depicts four childhood friends as they regroup in adulthood and aim to change their country&#x2019;s politics for the better&#x2015;Cardenas reveals, via some stunning and shapeshifting prose, that politics in Ecuador isn&#x2019;t as straightforward as it appears on its surface, and very often it amounts to little more than a vain exercise in egobuilding and self-fantasy.&#x201d; <strong><em>&#x2015;Kenyon Review</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;This is an original, insubordinate novel, like his grammar, like his syntax, but fabulously, compellingly readable, with endearing characters like Leopoldo&#x2019;s grandma, who would tie a white plastic bag on her head like a wig and perform Macbeth for him at her farm, proclaiming in unintelligible English, &#x2018;Blo win, crack you cheek, rage! Blo!&#x2019;&#x201d; <strong><em>&#x2015;New York Time Sunday Book Review</em></strong><br><br>"Mauro Javier Cardenas&#x2019;s d�but, The Revolutionaries Try Again, tells the tale of three Ecuadorian friends&#x2015;one living in exile in San Francisco, the other two still in Guayaquil&#x2015;who come together in a quixotic attempt to take the country&#x2019;s Presidency. 'Everyone thinks they&#x2019;re the chosen ones,' one character reminds another, and Cardenas&#x2019;s gift is to show, through long, brilliant sentences, the charm of inaction and delinquency." <strong><em>&#x2015;The New Yorker</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Drawing on everything from pop culture to Ecuadorian politics, and posing questions about faith, morality, and devotion to one&#x2019;s country and ideals (all expressed in a deviant postmodern style), Cardenas&#x2019;s spellbinding book should appeal to McOndo devotees and Bola�o fans alike. But The Revolutionaries taps into something more comprehensive and universally conscientious...

That is why he is so often called by the French 'Charlemagne', and by the Germans 'Karl der Grosse'. His strength of character was felt to be remarkable from early in his long reign. Warfare and accident, vermin and weather have destroyed much of the evidence for his rule in the twelve centuries since his death, but a remarkable amount still survives. <p>Janet L. Nelson's wonderful new book brings together everything we know about Charlemagne and sifts through the evidence to come as close as we can to understanding the man and his motives. Nelson has an extraordinary knowledge of the sources and much of the book is a sort of detective story, prying into and interpreting fascinating material and often obdurate scraps, from prayerbooks to skeletons, gossip to artwork.</p> <p>Above all, Charles's legacy lies in his deeds and their continuing resonance, as he shaped duchies and counties, rebuilt and founded towns and monasteries, and consciously set himself up not just as King of the Franks, but as the new 'Emperor governing the Roman Empire'. His successors - in some ways to the present day - have struggled to interpret, misinterpret, copy or subvert Charlemagne's legacy. Nelson gets us as close as we can ever hope to come to the real figure, as understood in his own time.</p></p><p><b>Janet L.

He starred in the Academy Award-winning film <em>Cold Mountain,</em> married (and split up with) supermodel Karen Elson, and rejuvenated a flagging Detroit art scene by making his hometown the headquarters of his record label, Third Man Records.

Immediately, strange and lurid rumors began circulating the neighborhood about what had happened. Some said she ran off with an egg seller; others supposed it was an aristocratic foxhunter who had taken young Bridget away. Swirling amid rumors was the barely whispered, but widely held, belief that Bridget had gone with no mortal man; rather, she had gone off with the fairies. The mystery deepened when seven days later her body was discovered, bent, broken and badly burned in a shallow grave. Within a few days, the unimaginable truth came to light: for almost a week before her death Bridget had been confined, ritually starved, threatened, physically and verbally abused, exorcised, and, finally, burned to death by her husband, Michael Cleary, her father, and extended family who confused bronchitis with a "fairy dart." They had all become convinced that "their Bridgie" had been taken from them and her fairy-possessed body left behind to deceive them. In <i>The Cooper's Wife Is Missing,</i> Joan Hoff and Marian Yeates make sense of this ancient, rarely publicized, ritual exorcism and explain how the incident went on to become a national and international incident. Set against a backdrop of renewed Irish nationalism, a Church crackdown on lingering pagan practices and the ongoing British humiliation of Catholic Ireland, the authors deftly map the dislocating anxieties that beset the rural peasantry in late nineteenth-century Ireland. Bewildered and frightened by the changes occurring all around them, pulled in all directions by their politicians, priests, landlords and English overlords, the Clearys were not alone in retreating to the relative comfort of pagan ritual. Drawing on first-hand accounts, contemporary newspaper reports, police records, trial testimony and a rich wealth of folklore, the authors weave a mesmerizing tale that touches upon magic, madness and mystery as it details, day by day, Bridget's ordeal and the resulting investigation. This is narrative history at its evocative best. It fascinates as it illuminates.</p><p>Joan Hoff is Director of the Contemporary History Institute of the University of Ohio. She held the Mary Ball Washington Chair at University College Dublin in 1993-94 and is the author of Nixon Reconsidered and Law, Gender and Injustice. <p>Marian Yeates has a Ph.D. in American History from Indiana University. She writes and publishes commissioned family histories and plans a new book on the Old South.</p>One of two books this season on the legendary death in 1895 of an Irish country woman, this account illuminates more broadly "how Ireland suffered, how she struggled and what she faced in her fight to win her freedom." In contrast to linguist Angela Bourke's The Burning of Bridget Cleary (see below), historians Hoff (of the University of Toledo and author of Nixon Reconsidered) and Yeates (an independent scholar with a Ph.D. from Indiana University) use Cleary's death to reconstruct a primarily political history. They begin by describing the "rebellious South Tipperary" of 1895. Still reeling from the Great Famine and the bloody Land Wars of the 1880s, Tipperary was tightly structured, on one side, by the landlords and the British government and, on the other, by the Catholic Church and a poor, nationalistic and fairy-believing peasantry. Against this backdrop lived the cooper Michael Cleary and his wife, Bridget. A pretty and independent woman, Bridget was "a bit queer." She had her own income and, after almost eight years of marriage, she was childless. When she fell ill, her husband, convinced his real wife had been abducted by a fairy and that a changeling remained in her place, began a grueling ritual meant to exorcise the changelingAbut which, instead, led to Bridget's death by burning. Placing the testimony from Michael Cleary's murder trial at the center of their account, Hoff and Yeates meticulously dissect the days leading up to Bridget's deathAand present a subtle account of the interpersonal, economic, political and sociological tensions that surrounded it. Meanwhile, they deliver a series of wonderful profiles of "testy" nationalists like the archbishop of Cashel, Thomas William Croke, and the revolutionary politician Charles Stewart Parnell. (And their outstanding first chapter contains an excellent analysis of Irish history and the Catholic Church 1858-1895.) Heavily footnotedAbut livelyAthis volume brings new clarity and perspective to an important moment in Irish history.

But he also loves the sound of the coins jingling in his money box, and so he never actually buys the eels, content just to smell them for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Struggling to make a living selling his eels, Sabu is furious with Yoshi for his stubbornness, and demands payment for all the eels Yoshi has sniffed. Yoshi retaliates by performing a wild coin-rattling dance in the street: "chin chin jara jara... chin jara jara...." When he finishes, he tells Sabu, "You have charged me for the smell of your eels, and I have paid you with the sound of my money." Is there any hope of reconciliation for these feuding neighbors?<p> Adapted from the Japanese folktale "Smells and Jingles," this hilarious story shows that in business--and in life--you usually get what you pay for. Compromise often ends up being the most satisfying arrangement all around. Yumi Heo's oil, pencil, and collage illustrations are the real treasure.

Original.</p><p><p>Kara Dalkey is the author of several fantasy books, including <i>Little Sister, The Nightingale,</i> and <i>Blood of the Goddess</i> series. She lives in Gunnison, CO.</p>Gr. 7-10. In the third and final volume in the Transformation series, teen mermyd Nia, must return from Wales to Atlantis to find a magical sword that is potentially the last hope to save her beloved city from evil tyrant Ma'el. Accompanied by her "dry-lander" friend Corwin, Nia makes the dangerous underwater journey, only to discover that the sword is missing, her people are enslaved, and Ma'el is planning to take over Corwin's Wales. Finding the sword and stopping Ma'el are more perilous than Nia imagined, especially with her future and the fate of Atlantis at stake. Sf and fantasy fans will connect with the likable teen protagonists; descriptive, fast-reading prose; and an exotic, richly detailed, fantastical world that combines elements of Atlantis, alien-earth population theory, and King Arthur legends. Plot devices and obstacles feature Indiana Jones-like thrills, rounded out with hints of romance and a classic good vs. evil struggle. Engrossing, suspenseful, and fun. <i>Shelle Rosenfeld</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

The only trouble is, fear comes in so many different shapes and sizes these days. It comes as rejection by a beautiful woman. It comes in the brutalization of your love by an amoral man. It comes with the threat of impending nuclear holocaust; with the slithering shadows in the city streets; with the ripoff artists who lie in wait behind every television commercial. Fear is the erratic behavior of all the nut cases and whackos walking the streets-they look just like you and me and your lover and your mother-and all they need is a wrong word and there they go to the top of an apartment building with a sniperscope'd rifle. Fear is all around you. You have nothing to fear but fear itself, right? Sure. The only trouble is, the minute you get all the rational fears taken care of, all battened down and secure, here comes something new. Like what? Well, like the special fears generated in these 16 incredible stories. Fear described as it's never been described before, by the startling imagination of Harlan Ellison, master fantasist, tour-guide through the land of dreadful visions, unerring observer of human folly and supernatural diabolism. Or, quoting the Louisville Courier-Journal &amp; Times, Ellison's "stories are kaleidoscopic in their range, breathtaking in their beauty, hideous in their deformity, insulting in their arrogance and unarguable in the accuracy of their insight."

French immigrants who arrived in America January 1, 1800, the du Ponts became a dynasty of publicity-shy entrepreneurs, engineers, horticulturists, and collectors. They built neighboring houses, gardens, and farms that spanned miles of rolling hills in the Brandywine Valley and earned the region the sobriquet Chateau Country. With their riches from the DuPont Company, the family pursued many passions, resulting in the exquisite art collections, botanical gardens, and libraries now enjoyed by the American public. The du Ponts: Houses and Gardens in the Brandywine, 1900 1951, features 25 du Pont family houses and farms, including the celebrated Winterthur, Longwood, and Nemours estates. There are unexpected surprises: Bellevue, a replica of James Madison s Montpelier; Eleutherian Mills, the 19th-century partnership house overlooking the Brandywine Creek, resurrected in the 1920s as a colonial mansion with a garden that was considered one of most successful romantic conceits of the 20th century; and Hod House, the Hodgson system prefabricated residence built as a summer retreat on 550 acres. Winterthur Museum s estate historian Maggie Lidz captures the life of the du Ponts at home with hundreds of rare period photographs from private archives and family albums and never before published autochromes, diascopes, and Dufay color images. The Crowninshields, the Sharps, the Homseys and the du Ponts - Henry Francis, Pierre Samuel, and Coleman- all come alive as we visit their country manors, horse farms, and spectacular gardens in the bucolic setting of the Brandywine Valley.</p><p>Maggie Lidz is estate historian for Winterthur Museum, a du Pont family estate that dates back to 1839.

The story, narrated by 26-year-old Kate Morrison, is set in the eponymous Crow Lake, an isolated rural community where time has stood still. The reader dives in and out of a year&#39;s worth of Kate&#39;s childhood memories--when she was 7 and her parents were killed in an automobile accident that left Kate, her younger sister Bo, and two older brothers, Matt and Luke, orphaned. When Kate, the successful zoologist and professor who is accustomed to dissecting everything through a microscope, receives an invitation to Matt&#39;s son&#39;s 18th birthday party, she must suddenly analyze her own relationship and come to terms with her past before she forsakes a future with the man she loves.</p><p><b>Crow Lake</b> is that rare find, a first novel so quietly assured, so emotionally pitch perfect, you know from the opening page that this is the real thing?a literary experience in which to lose yourself, by an author of immense talent.<br><br>Here is a gorgeous, slow-burning story set in the rural ?badlands? of northern Ontario, where heartbreak and hardship are mirrored in the landscape. For the farming Pye family, life is a Greek tragedy where the sins of the fathers are visited on the sons, and terrible events occur?offstage. <br><br>Centerstage are the Morrisons, whose tragedy looks more immediate if less brutal, but is, in reality, insidious and divisive. Orphaned young, Kate Morrison was her older brother Matt?s protegee, her fascination for pond life fed by his passionate interest in the natural world. Now a zoologist, she can identify organisms under a microscope but seems blind to the state of her own emotional life. And she thinks she?s outgrown her siblings?Luke, Matt, and Bo?who were once her entire world. <br><br>In this universal drama of family love and misunderstandings, of resentments harbored and driven underground, Lawson ratchets up the tension with heartbreaking humor and consummate control, continually overturning one?s expectations right to the very end.

Meanwhile, filmmakers have long been intrigued by psychiatry and frequently portray this mysterious world in film. Both movies and psychiatry focus on human thought, emotions, behavior, and motivation -- making a link between the two subjects inevitable.</p><p>Psychiatry and the Cinema explores this complementary relationship from two angles, psychiatrists who have studied the movies and movies that have depicted psychiatry. This second edition has updated this definitive text with a discussion of new trends in psychoanalytically oriented film theory, and an expanded list of movies is analyzed.</p><p>Glen and Krin Gabbard survey more than 400 theatrically released American films that feature psychiatrists or other mental health professionals at work. In part one, the authors examine the stereotypical characters and conventions dominating the presentation of movie psychiatrists, trace the historical rise and fall of the image of the psychotherapist in the movies, and relate that history to societal views about psychiatry and psychiatric treatment.</p><p>In part two, the authors explain state-of-the-art psychoanalytic film criticism and illustrates the use of that methodology with films such as Casablanca, Alien, Three Women, Sea of Love, Working Girl, Good Will Hunting and many more. In total, this comprehensive edition reviews hundreds of movies through the eyes of the psychiatrically informed. It also discusses the clinical implications of the film representations of psychotherapy for the mental health practitioner.</p><p>Both entertaining and educational, this book serves as an important aid in understanding the special hold that movies have on audiences.</p><p>Glen O.

Were the terrorists motivated by the true dictates of their religion, or had they hijacked Islam as well as the planes in a political cause unrelated to the teachings of Muhammad?<p><i>Christianity, Islam and Atheism</i> argues that Islam is a religion of conquest and subjugation and that in spite of 9/11 and thousands of other terrorist attacks throughout the world, many Western people still do not know or admit this truth because it conflicts with their belief in multiculturalism and its insistence on the equivalence of all cultures and religions.</p><p>To meet the challenge from Islam, Christians need to know more about the striking differences between Islam and Christianity, yet many Christians have been lulled into complacency by the misleading and largely unexamined assumption that Christians and Muslims share similar beliefs. The time that Christians spend in pursuing false hopes of finding common ground is time that Islamic activists are using to press their militant agenda.</p><p>In addition to challenging both the multicultural and common-ground approaches, William Kilpatrick also exposes the role played by atheists and secularists in advancing Islam's totalitarian agenda. Despite playing lip service to freedom, radical secularists willingly serve as enablers of radical Islam. The civil liberties that Americans and Europeans enjoy are the fruit of Christian civilization, Kilpatrick argues, and only a reawakened Christianity can defend them against Islam's advance.</p></p><p><p><strong>William Kilpatrick</strong> is the author of several books, including <em>Psychological Seduction</em> <em>Why Johnny Can't Tell Right from Wrong</em>. His articles on Islam have appeared in<em> Investor's Business Daily, FrontPage Magazine, Jihad Watch, Catholic World Report,</em> the <em>National Catholic Register, World</em>, and other publications. Professor Kilpatrick, who taught for many years at Boston College, lectures frequently to audiences in the US and abroad.</p>"This extraordinary book pierces through the politically correct miasma of unreality that envelops us and explains clearly and persuasively, with mountains of evidence, the threat that Islam poses today to the Church and to Western civilization. William Kilpatrick is to be commended for penning a concise and comprehensive introduction to the reality and magnitude of the Islamic supremacist threat. This book should be essential reading for politicians, bishops, and everyone who is on the front lines of the culture wars." --<b>Robert Spencer</b>, author of the NY Times bestseller <i>The Truth About Muhammad</i><br><br>"Kilpatrick's insights into Western relativism, multiculturalism, and the resultant anti-Christian attitudes form a matrix by which the rot of a crumbling society can be better understood . . . This book summons Christians to awaken their love for the true Jesus Christ of the Gospel, to learn sober truth about Christianity and Islam, and live their faith courageously in the face of Muslim aggression." --<b>Mitch Pacwa, SJ</b>, Author, <i>St. Paul and the Power of the Cross</i><br><br>"Most politicians, journalists, and intellectuals either fall silent on the subject of Islamic theology or sanitize it through platitudes, all of which revolve around religious and cultural relativism. As William Kilpatrick convincingly shows in <i>Christianity, Islam, and Atheism</i>, this fashionable complacency has compromised Western civilization. In this indispensable book, he wakes the politically correct up from their dogmatic slumbers, sounding a vitally important alarm about the true aims of Islam." --<b>George Neumayr</b>, contributing editor to <i>The American Spectator</i> and co-author of <i>No Higher Power: Obama's War on Religious Freedom</i></p><h2>The Settlement Cookbook</h2><p>Discusses the fundamentals of cooking and collects a variety of recipes for breads, soups, fish, meat, vegetables, desserts, sauces, and beverages</p><p></p><h2>On Silver Wings: The Women Airforce Service Pilots of World War II</h2><p>THEY WERE THE WOMEN WITH THE RIGHT STUFF.<br>They were heroic women who came from every corner of the nation and every walk of life: debutantes, teachers, businesswomen, housewives, daughters of farmers, and factory workers.

Freelance journalist Verges, wife of an airline executive, is candid about how women began making their contributions in the air: the chief impetus was provided by famed pilot Jacqueline Cochran, married to a millionaire tycoon who provided strong financial support to Franklin Roosevelt; almost all other early women pilots were from wealthy families, since flying was at first a hobby only for the rich. This profile changed by the early 1940s, when almost 2000 women had earned their wings and become indispensable to the war effort, ferrying planes around the country. They were fortunate in having the support of Air Force boss Gen. Hap Arnold and some young officers, but many mid-ranking members of the brass were petty and even vicious toward the women. The WASP was disbanded in late 1944 and the personnel were denied military rank; this they were finally awarded in 1973. An inspiring tale of a winning fight against prejudice. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.During World War II, two competing efforts were begun to organize a unit of women pilots to do noncombat flying for the military. When the Army Air Force finally accepted the system devised by racing pilot Jacqueline Cochrane, the other group joined it to train and dispatch pilots for test and ferry assignments all over the United States. Sadly, Congress did not pass the Costello Bill to absorb this corps, called the Women's Airforce Service Pilots (WASPs) into the military (meaning commissions and other benefits of service), and Cochrane abruptly disbanded the force of over 1000. In their short service they delivered every military aircraft in the inventory, flew 60 million miles, and lost 38 of their number to flying accidents. An exhaustive and often poignant history of this little-known contribution to the war effort. Recommended for both aviation and women's studies collections.

Lane, Sacramento, Cal.</i><br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Son of a Preacher Man: My Search for Grace in the Shadows</h2><p><p><em>In Son of a Preacher Man</em> Jay Bakker, son of famous televangelists Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker, tells the compelling story of growing up in the glaring lights of a television studio. It's all here: the Bakker family's public disgrace, the fall of the PTL (Praise The Lord) media empire, and Bakker's subsequent plunge into a morass of anxiety and selfdestruction. But <em>Son of a Preacher Man</em> is more than a tell-all -- it is a story that dramatizes the human toll of this tragedy on the Bakker family, with insight into the seismic shifts that nearly destroyed his father and wrecked his parents' longtime marriage. It is the story of a prodigal son's return to the true meaning of God's love and acceptance. It is the story of a boy who was lost, but on the journey back from ruin finds a better way to understand and live life. It is the story of discovering God's grace and of becoming a man.</p><p>Despite years of disillusionment, alcoholism, and heartbreak, Bakker managed to continue on his spiritual quest. First he worked to redeem his father...then his faith. Bakker began his service with Revolution, a ministry for skateboarders, punk rockers, and hippiesthe street kids he knew best. He shared the message that saved his life -- the message of Jesus that God's love is infinitely generous. Now Bakker has a large and growing ministry among the tattooed and pierced of downtown Atlanta who feel rejected by the traditional Church yet flock to hear his message of grace and love.</p><p>Ultimately, <em>Son of a Preacher Man</em> is a story about resurrection -- of one lost young man, of his disgraced and imprisoned father, and of the hope that can't be destroyed by the machinations of power-hungry preachers, The long, lonely road that Bakker traveled taught him that you can't earn or make yourself worthy of the love of God, but if you are willing to let go and open up, that infinite love is waiting to welcome you home with open arms.</p></p><p>By any standard, Jay Bakker has had it rough. The son of Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker, Jay was only 11 years old when his parents' empire collapsed and his family was vilified as the epitome of televangelism's excesses. Jay Bakker's autobiography, <i>Son of a Preacher Man</i>, unflinchingly addresses all of his family's major scandals, including his father's affair with Jessica Hahn and his mother's battle with drug addiction. Bakker also reveals that by age 13, he had developed a serious drinking problem, and that was only the beginning of a long period of rebellion that intensified during his father's years in prison. After his father's release, Jim and Jay began to rebuild their relationship, and Jay, though still struggling with alcoholism, discerned a calling to ministry. After several false starts he built a ministry to young people in Atlanta called Revolution. As a minister, Bakker's main interest is in the kids that churches overlook--the pierced, tattooed, smoking, drinking kind. The message of this ministry, like the message of this book, is simple: "Jesus loves you for who you are, not who you can become." Bakker says that he still works every day to learn that lesson, and to pass it on to others, as he does with some eloquence in <i>Son of a Preacher Man</i>. <i>--Paul Power</i>Jay Bakker lives in Atlanta with his wife, Amanda. They both work for Safehouse Outreach, where Jay is the pastor of Revolution, a ministry to a disillusioned subculture.</p><h2>Deep Trouble: Goosebumps</h2><p>While visiting his uncle, Dr. Deep, on a tiny Caribbean island, Billy goes exploring underwater, ignoring warnings to stay away from the coral reef, and is stalked by a half-human, half-fish predator</p><p>R.L.

The mental exercise that audio gives to the imagination has more positive effects on kids than the mind-numbing boob tube. Perhaps that&#39;s why, when Disney rereleased some of its postwar kids albums on cassette a few years ago, they were sold out within weeks of hitting the shelves. In this instance, even merely serviceable performance does wonders for Stine&#39;s hack writing. Disney has pumped more energy than creativity into the slickly produced title. It&#39;s amiable, briskly paced and safe. Neither parents nor their offspring will find any unpleasant shocks here.

Latin American artists turned to conceptualism as a vehicle for radically questioning the very nature of art itself, as well as art's role in responding to societal needs and crises in conjunction with politics, poetry, and pedagogy. Because of this distinctive agenda, Latin American conceptualism must be viewed and understood in its own right, not as a derivative of Euroamerican models.</p> <p>In this book, one of Latin America's foremost conceptualist artists, Luis Camnitzer, offers a firsthand account of conceptualism in Latin American art. Placing the evolution of conceptualism within the history Latin America, he explores conceptualism as a strategy, rather than a style, in Latin American culture. He shows how the roots of conceptualism reach back to the early nineteenth century in the work of S�mon Rodr�guez, S�mon Bol�var's tutor. Camnitzer then follows conceptualism to the point where art crossed into politics, as with the Argentinian group <em>Tucum�n arde</em> in 1968, and where politics crossed into art, as with the Tupamaro movement in Uruguay during the 1960s and early 1970s. Camnitzer concludes by investigating how, after 1970, conceptualist manifestations returned to the fold of more conventional art and describes some of the consequences that followed when art evolved from being a political tool to become what is known as "political art."</p></p><p>LUIS CAMNITZER, an award-winning artist, essayist, and critic, is Professor Emeritus of Art at SUNY Old Westbury. He served as Viewing Program Curator at the Drawing Center in New York City from 1999 to 2006.

Forming an air arsenal which was totally unique in its composition and application, they combined the firepower of P-51A fighters and B-25H bombers with the logistical tentacles of C-47 transports, CG-4A gliders, L-5 and L-1 light planes, and UC-64 bush planes to reach far behind Japanese lines.

Later, she married Sweden's ambassador to the French court, and for a span of twenty years, she held the limelight as a political figure and prolific writer. Despite a plain appearance, she was notoriously seductive and enjoyed whirlwind affairs with some of the most influential men of her time. She always attracted controversy, and was demonized by Napoleon for her forthrightness, the sheer power of her intellect, and the progressiveness of her salon, which was a hotbed for the expression of liberal ideals. The emperor exiled her, on and off, for the last fifteen years of her life.<br><br>Madame de Sta�l&#x2014;force of nature, exuberant idealist, and ultimate enthusiast&#x2014;waged a lifelong struggle against all that was tyrannical, cynical, or passionless in her time, and left Europe a legacy of enlightened liberalism that radiated throughout the continent during the nineteenth century.</p><p><b>Francine du Plessix Gray</b> is the author of <i>Them: A Memoir of Parents</i>, which won the National Book Critics Circle Award; <i>At Home with the Marquis de Sade</i>, which was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize; and numerous other works, including a biography of Simone Weil in the Penguin Lives series. She lives in Warren, Connecticut.Novelist, philosopher, <i>salonni�re</i> and a woman whose political genius was worthy of the wiliest D.C. lobbyist: Germaine de Sta�l (1766&#x2013;1817) lived many lives during the chaotic years of French history from the Revolution through the machinations of Napoleon. NBCC Award&#x2013;winning author Gray (<i>Them: A Memoir of Parents</i>) chronicles her subject's combination of charisma and historical circumstance, manifest in de Sta�l's celebrated salons, impassioned literary tracts and iconoclastic personality. More than the quintessential cosmopolitan, de Sta�l saved lives during the Terror and launched careers. Yet before marrying her inept husband, she said, I regret that I have not joined my fate to that of a great man; it is the only possible glory for a woman. Despite repeated exile from Napoleon's France, de Sta�l was as linked to the political workings of Parisian society as any of her male contemporaries. Faithful to de Sta�l's incessant energy, Gray follows her movements at a forceful pace, masterfully commanding a wide cast of characters while streamlining the frantic narrative of her subject's life. The reader trusts Gray completely, but wants more of the peerless de Sta�l. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

An uncompromising and frequently contentious anti-communist, Henderson left his unmistakable imprint on many crucial policy decisions, ranging from the delay of recognition of the Soviet Union in the 1920s and 1930s, to the Truman doctrine of the 1940s, to the overthrow of the Mosadeq government of Iran during the 1950s. Now, in this fascinating biography, H.W. Brands recounts Loy Henderson's far-flung diplomatic career and, in doing so, opens a window onto the entire Cold War Era.<br> Henderson's ascent to a position of major influence among American foreign-policy makers paralleled the rise of the United States to unprecedented influence in global affairs, with anti-communism providing much of the impetus and rationale in both cases. Henderson acquired his life-long preoccupation with the communist menace--a preoccupation that reflected his psychological make-up and personal history, as well as the objective actions of Soviet leaders--in Moscow in the mid-1930s, when he served with the first group of American diplomats posted to the Soviet Union. He witnessed directly the terror and brutality of the Stalinist system, and he spent the rest of his career agitating against anything that might facilitate the spread of that system. Henderson's refusal to compromise his convictions threw him repeatedly into conflict with his superiors--as during World War II, when he warned that Soviet cooperation was a cynical and passing phenomenon, and in the fight over American support for the creation of Israel, when he predicted that American backing for the Zionists would alienate the Arabs and lay the Middle East open to Soviet penetration. In each instance, Henderson's outspokenness led to professional exile; but each time he succeeded in working his way back to the center of the decision-making process. <br> Brands's compelling narrative captures the drama of some of the key developments in international politics in the twentieth century. We find Henderson sifting the rubble of World War I in Eastern Europe, taking a front-row seat at the Moscow purge trials, assessing the future of awakening Iraq during World War II, orchestrating America's cold-war assumption of Britain's imperial burden in Greece and Turkey, challenging the neutralism of India's Nehru during the Korean war, and engineering the restoration of the shah of Iran. Brands's tale, based on Henderson's personal and official papers, and on the papers and recollections of many of Henderson's associates, is more than a biography; it is a chronicle of the most eventful period in recent American and world history, told through the life of one of the individuals who helped make the period so dramatic.</p><p><br><em>About the Author:</em><br> <strong>H.W. Brands</strong> is Associate Professor of History at Texas A &amp; M University. He is the author of such books as <em>The Cold Warriors</em> and <em>The Specter of Neutralism</em>.<br>As director of the State Department's division of Near Eastern and African affairs, Loy Henderson (1896-1986) played an important role in the creation of the Truman Doctrine which, according to Brands, served as "the blueprint of America's anti-communist empire." Henderson's distrust of Soviet intentions caused him to oppose U.S. support for a Jewish state in Palestine; he argued that America's future lay with the Arabs both because of their oil and their strategic position in terms of containing Soviet expansion. As ambassador to Iran he decided that prime minister Mohammed Mosadeq's squabbles with the British would ultimately benefit Moscow, and his recommendation to Washington that Mosadeq be deposed resulted in the CIA-engineered coup in 1953. Brands, an associate professor of history at Texas A &amp; M, shows how Henderson's narrow focus on the communist threat contributed to the essentially negative U.S. foreign policy of the early Cold War years. His well-researched portrait of this colorless, humorless, one-track-minded Cold Warrior will be of interest to specialists. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Wrong Men: America&#39;s Epidemic of Wrongful Death Row Convictions</h2><p>In January 2000, Illinois Governor George H. Ryan declared a moratorium on state executions. Three years later, Ryan commuted all Illinois death sentences to life imprisonment, saying, &#x201c;Our capital system is haunted by the demon of error, error in determining guilt, and error in determining who among the guilty deserves to die.&#x201d; This book chronicles over one hundred cases where journalism students, grassroots organizations, families, and pro bono lawyers&#x2014;armed with DNA evidence and other instruments of justice&#x2014;have defeated that demon. Cohen reveals how eyewitness error, jailhouse snitch testimony, racism, junk science, prosecutorial misconduct, and incompetent counsel have often populated America&#x2019;s death row with the wrong men. Readers embark on journeys with men who were arrested, convicted, sentenced to death, dragged through the appeals system, and finally set free based on their actual innocence. Some languished for decades in our death houses. Notable cases of wrongful imprisonment outside of death row are also profiled. Although these stories end with vindication, there are those that have ended with unjustified execution. The Wrong Men is sure to fuel controversy over a justice system that has delivered the ultimate punishment 820 times since 1976, though it cannot guarantee accurate convictions.</p><p><b>Stanley Cohen</b> is a veteran award-winning newspaper and magazine journalist. For more than fifty years, he has worked as an editor, writer, and reporter for newspapers, magazines, and an international news service. He also has taught writing, journalism, and philosophy at Hunter College. He lives in Tomkins Cove, New York.As the title suggests, Cohen (The Man in the Crowd) examines some 100 instances where people sentenced to death were later exonerated, most of them ultimately proven innocent of the crimes for which they were condemned. The capsule profiles of the exonerated are often too sketchy to be fully satisfactory. Still, Cohen makes his case that innocent people regularly receive death sentences merely through the cumulative effect of the stories. Cohen also analyzes the chief reasons why wrongful convictions occur so frequently. Eyewitness error is a prime factor, whether because of simple mistake or pressure from law enforcement officials. Again, prosecutors avid for convictions distort trials by inducing or winking at perjury or by suppressing evidence favorable to the accused. Other wrongful convictions are attributed to junk science, such as having witnesses' memories stimulated by amateur hypnotists. The author's explanations of these sources of capital error are straightforward and clarified by well-chosen examples. DNA analysis, as the book also explains, has become the main vehicle for exonerating the innocent, but in many cases no DNA evidence is available. Cohen believes the death penalty will soon be relegated to the "dark and distant past," and this volume is a convincing argument for the unreliability of capital convictions. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Whatever Happened to Harold Absalon?</h2><p>Marguerite, a down-at-heel detective, investigates, in minute and comically digressive detail, the disappearance of Harold Absalon, the Mayor&#39;s transport advisor. He follows, and then is followed by, Harold&#39;s wife Isobel and their young child around an unnamed modern city resembling London. Finding himself cornered by Isobel it emerges that Marguerite may be more closely implicated than we think.</p><p>Simon Okotie was born to Nigerian/English parents. His autobiographical first novel about growing up in rural Norfolk was a runner-up for the 1998 Saga Prize for black British fiction. He has a First Class engineering degree and Master&#39;s degrees in Philosophy and Transport Planning. He lives in London.Okotie&#39;s protagonist, Marguerite, is an investigator (of some kind) charged (by someone) with following the wife of Harold Absalon after the disappearance (perhaps) of her husband. Hardly a nail-biting procedural, the action such as it is goes no further than up and down in an elevator and onto a bus-a timespan of a few minutes, at most. It&#39;s a marvel of compression, not in the manner of Jean Echenoz and others who strip the detective novel down to its bones, but by taking a few minor, even meaningless moments of a larger investigation and exploding them to the point of rewarding absurdity. * Necessary Fiction * ... charming and fresh; indeed, the only recent comparable fiction would be Will Self&#39;s Booker-shortlisted Umbrella, which also features a prolonged, digressive sequence set on a London bus. Simon Okotie&#39;s book will receive less attention, but it is equally audacious, and in its own, low-key way, just as compelling. -- David Evans * Financial Times *</p><h2>Fresh Picked Posies: 12 Quilt Blocks to Applique from Piece O?

Shortly after graduation, he married Marjorie Bradford, and they settled down in New York City, where he worked for several newspapers and magazines. In 1941, before the attack on Pearl Harbor, he joined the U. S. Navy and was later trained to command small PT attack boats. He served in the Navy in the North and South Atlantic theaters and was on his way to the Pacific campaign when the war ended in 1945. He returned to New York and joined his wife and five year-old son, Peter. The next year, they had another son, Nathaniel Robert.</p><p>Nathaniel Benchley worked as a freelance writer &#x2013;and painter- for the next 36 years. He wrote novels, plays, short stories, reviews, movie scripts and a very popular biography of the actor Humphrey Bogart. Much of his material was drawn from his life in New York and Nantucket, MA, where the family had a summer home. He found the small town life in Nantucket was rich in characters and material for adventures. He wrote a book titled The Off-Islanders, which was later made into a successful movie called "The Russians Are Coming! The Russians Are Coming!" It was the story of a Russian submarine run aground on a small New England island. Several of his other books were also made into movies.</p><p>His sideline as a painter of landscapes led to his participation in many gallery showings.</p><p>Mr. Benchley used his fascination with history to create a series of books for beginning and teen readers. His particular interest was in taking a moment in history and examining it through the eyes of a young boy. He told stories about the Vikings coming to what would later be called "America;" Native American Indians dealing with the new settlers in their land ("Small Wolf"); young boys in Colonial America ("Sam the Minuteman" and "George the Drummer Boy") and the movement west; and a young boy who joins the Navy during World War II. </p><p>He also wrote a series of books for very beginning readers, many of which were about animals and their special bonds with humans ("Red Fox and His Canoe," "Oscar Otter").</p><p>He was always proudest of the letters he got from young readers who had identified with one of his characters and wanted to ask questions raised by their reading. He personally answered every letter he got from his readers.</p><p>In 1974, his son, Peter, published his first novel, Jaws, based on his experiences fishing off Nantucket in his youth (and a healthy imagination).</p><p>For the last many years of his life, Nathaniel Benchley lived in Nantucket with his wife.</p><p>Nathaniel Benchley lived by the motto: "A craftsman is one who does what he is given to do better than others feel is necessary."He died in Boston, MA, in 1981.</p><br><br>Ben Shecter was born in New York Cityand studied at The High School ofMusic and Art and at the Yale Graduate School of Drama.

The principals of distilling described is this book are correct but the methods used by today's "urban" moonshiner have changed because every town in America has a home brew shop where he or she can take a home brewing class and buy his ingredients to make beer and moonshine. (Mostly yeast and sugar.) The techniques described in this book are not used by today's modern moonshiner because better how-to information (books) and equipment are readily available. It is estimated that there are 15,000 modern moonshiners in the USA and the industry is currently going through a renaissance.

Simultaneous.</p><p>As the number of entries dwindles (28 last time, 24 this), the average length increases; here, take out the two novellas previously published as independent hardcovers (Michael Swanwick's Griffin's Egg and Frederik Pohl's Outnumbering the Dead) and the short-story version of Arthur C. Clarke's latest novel, The Hammer of Gold (p. 492), and 1992's Best SF begins to look decidedly hyperbolic. Still, veteran Kate Wilhelm's sharp, affecting tale of a lonely man helping a mutant child evade capture by predatory government agents is a standout. Again, Connie Willis not only writes a story about menstruation but succeeds in making it funny. Similarly amusing is Terry Bisson's foray into art and time travel. On the other side of the coin, Ian R. MacLeod weighs in with a creepy, unpleasantly fascinating future coming-of-age yarn; Joe Haldeman encounters some horrible Vietnam corpses; Nancy Kress portrays a grim future US with genetic screening and without medical insurance. And Tom Maddox writes tellingly of how real science is done or, rather, distorted by scientists. Also on the agenda, with less variety than usual: alternate worlds, time travel, computer personalities, art history and ecology, a spiritual crisis, labor camps, future grunge, artificial intelligence, literary figures, celebrities, names, and technology. Finally, a disappointing entry in a hitherto superlative series. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Although Dozois ( Geodesic Dreams ) has assembled a collection of 24 very good stories and enhances it with a useful list of runner-up titles, one suspects these tales betray Dozois's idiosyncratic taste more than they represent "the year's best." Consider Ian R. MacLeod's alternative speculation on the Beatles. "Never quite made it to the very top," says one woman in this story, which finds an unemployed, 50-year-old John Lennon smoking, drinking and picking the fluff off his feet, while Paul, George, Ringo and Stuart Sutcliffe--who never did make it to the top--are still plugging along. It may be entertaining to Beatles fans, but not much more than that. Frederick Pohl describes how "vid" superstar Rafiel Gutmaker-Fensterborn, a mortal in a largely immortal society, give his final performance (in a tap-dance version of Oedipus Rex ) and finally evades oblivion the old-fashioned way: parenthood. Nancy Kress gives a grim picture of the near future in which gene scans for potential disease can be used to deny people employment and health insurance and doctors who dare treat the uninsurables can endanger their own lucrative careers and risk becoming professional outcasts. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Utopian Feminism: Women`s Movements in Fin-de-Siecle Vienna</h2><p>Women's movements in Vienna at the turn of the century made valuable and original contributions to social reform, feminist ideology, and artistic and intellectual trends of the era. This book - the first to examine these movements in depth - discusses their historical development, the activities, personalities, and writings of their predominantly middle-class members, and the Viennese culture and politics in which they flourished.<br>Harriet Anderson argues that the movements did not primarily focus on women's rights but were utopian in spirit, seeking to bring about the moral reform of society through women's efforts. She discusses the numerous women's associations that sprang up at the turn of the century, groups that focussed on women's education and employment, legal reform, state-controlled prostitution, and anti-Semitism, among other issues.<br>Examining the General Austrian Women's Association in particular, Anderson reconstructs its history and describes the ideals that informed it, the personal loves and animosities of its leading figures, and the conflicts in which it engaged up to its decline in the chaos of the First World War. Next she critically analyses the feminists' theoretical writings, placing them in their intellectual contexts, investigating their poetics, and showing how they were shaped by various utopian visions. Finally she discusses the women's fictional works, identifying two main groups of feminist writers, one that wrote mainly moral texts supporting the prevalent middle-class code of conduct, and the other that sought to investigate psychological mechanisms and expose deep-rooted oppression.</p><p></p><h2>Princess Hyacinth (The Surprising Tale of a Girl Who Floated)</h2><p>Bestselling Caldecott Honor artist Lane Smith and legendary author Florence Parry Heide&nbsp;have teamed up to create an unforgettable princess sure to charm and delight young readers.<br><br> Princess Hyacinth has a problem: she floats. And so the king and queen have pebbles sewn into the tops of her socks, and force her to wear a crown encrusted with the heaviest jewels in the kingdom to keep her earthbound. But one day, Hyacinth comes across a balloon man and decides to take off all her princess clothes, grab a balloon, and float free. Hooray! Alas, when the balloon man lets go of the string . . . off she goes.

The generals who led the brigades, divisions, corps and armies of the Confederacy were very largely products of the same professional backgrounds as their opponents in Union blue - indeed, many of them were former West Point classmates and brother officers in the pre-war US Army, who had served together on the frontier or in the Mexican War. In terms of field experience they were also similar to the vast majority of Union commanders - none of them had ever commanded so much as a brigade before 1861, and they had to learn by trial and error. Some whose pre-war record had promised much were to fail the test of war; some more obscure officers were to rise to the challenge remarkably. This first of two volumes devoted to the Confederate generals details the careers, personalities and appearance of 25 commanders who made their names mainly with the Army of Northern Virginia in the Eastern theater of war.</p><p>An unrivalled illustrated reference source on fighting men and commanders, past and present. Each volume is packed with full colour artwork, making military history uniquely accessible to enthusiasts of all ages.Philip Katcher was born in Los Angeles, California, to parents involved in the film industry. He was educated at the University of Maryland and served in the US Army in Vietnam. He has also been an active participant in living history activities, especially in the 18th and 19th century periods. He has written a number of books on various periods of US military history and presently is editor/publisher of Military Images Magazine.</p><h2>Helmet For My Pillow</h2><p>Robert Leckie, one of America&#x2019;s greatest military historians, was both an eyewitness and participant to some of the greatest battles in the Pacific. This is Leckie&#x2019;s vivid account of combat and survival in World War II. In January 1942, in the aftermath of the infamous Japanese sneak attack on Pearl Harbor, he enlisted in the United States Marines Corps. From boot camp in Parris Island to the bloody war in the Pacific, Robert Leckie experienced it all. The booze, the brawling, the loving on sixty-two-hour liberty; the courageous fighting and dying in combat as the U.S. Marines slugged it out, inch by inch, island by island across the Pacific to the shores of Japan.</p><p>Robert Leckie is the critically acclaimed writer of Delivered From Evil: The Saga of World War II and None Died in Vain: The Saga of the Civil War.<i>Chapter One<br>Boot</i><br><br>A cutting wind slanted up Church Street in the cheerless dawn of January 5, 1942. That day I departed for the United States Marines.<br><br>The war with Japan was not yet four weeks old, Wake Island had fallen. Pearl Harbor was a real tragedy, a burning bitter humiliation. Hastily composed war songs were on the lips of everyone, their heavy patriotism failing to compensate for what they lacked in tune and spirit. Hysteria seemed to crouch behind all eyes.<br><br>But none of this meant much to me. I was aware of my father beside me, bending into the wind with me. I could feel the wound in my lower regions, still fresh, still sore. The sutures had been removed a few days earlier.<br><br>I had sought to enlist the day after Pearl Harbor, but the Marines had insisted that I be circumcised. It cost me a hundred dollars, although I am not sure to this day whether I paid the doctor or not. But I am certain that few young men went off to war in that fateful time so marked.<br><br>We had come across the Jersey meadows, riding the Erie commuter line, and then on the ferry over the Hudson River to downtown New York. Breakfast at home had been subdued. My mother was up and about; she did not cry. It was not a heart-rending leave-taking, nor was it brave, resolute&#x2014;any of those words that fail to describe the thing.<br><br>It was like so much else in this war that was to produce unbounded heroism, yet not a single stirring song: it was resigned. She followed me to the door with sad eyes and said, &#x201c;God keep you.&#x201d;<br><br>It had been a silent trip across the meadows and it was a wordless good-by in front of the bronze revolving doors at Ninety, Church Street. My father embraced me quickly, and just as quickly averted his face and left. The Irish doorman measured me and smiled.<br><br>I went inside and joined the United States Marines.<br><br>The captain who swore us in reduced the ceremony to a jumble. We all held up our hands. We put them down when he lowered his. That way we guessed we were marines.<br><br>The master gunnery sergeant who became our momentary shepherd made the fact plainer to us. Those rich mellow blasphemous oaths that were to become so familiar to me flowed from his lips with the consummate ease of one who had spent a lifetime in vituperation. I would meet his masters later. Presently, as he herded us across the river to Hoboken and a waiting train, he seemed to be beyond comparison. But he was gentle and kind enough when he said good-by to the thirty or forty of us who boarded the train.<br><br>He stood at the head of our railroad car&#x2014;a man of middle age, slender, and of a grace that was on the verge of being ruined by a pot belly. He wore the Marine dress blues. Over this was the regulation tight-fitting overcoat of forest green. Green and blue has always seemed to me an odd combination of colors, and it seemed especially so then; the gaudy dark and light blue of the Marine dress sheathed in sedate and soothing green.<br><br>&#x201c;Where you are going it will not be easy,&#x201d; the gunnery sergeant said. &#x201c;When you get to Parris Island, you&#x2019;ll find things plenty different from civilian life. You won&#x2019;t like it! You&#x2019;ll think they&#x2019;re overdoing things. You&#x2019;ll think they&#x2019;re stupid! You&#x2019;ll think they&#x2019;re the cruelest, rottenest bunch of men you ever ran into! I&#x2019;m going to tell you one thing. You&#x2019;ll be wrong! If you want to save yourself plenty of heartache you&#x2019;ll listen to me right now: you&#x2019;ll do everything they tell you and you&#x2019;ll keep your big mouths shut!&#x201d;<br><br>He could not help grinning at the end. No group of men ever had a saner counselor, and he knew it; but he could not help grinning. He knew we would ignore his every word.<br><br>&#x201c;Okay, Sarge,&#x201d; somebody yelled. &#x201c;Thanks, Sarge.&#x201d;<br><br>He turned and left us.<br><br>We called him &#x201c;Sarge.&#x201d; Within another twenty-four hours we would not dare address a lowly Pfc. without the cringing &#x201c;sir.&#x201d; But today the civilian shine was still upon us. We wore civvies; Hoboken howled around us in the throes of trade; we each had the citizen&#x2019;s polite deprecation of the soldier, and who among us was not certain that he was not long for the ranks?<br><br>Our ride to Washington was silent and uneventful. But once we had arrived in the capital and had changed trains the atmosphere seemed to lift. Other Marine recruits were arriving from all over the east. Our contingent was the last to arrive, the last to be crammed aboard the ancient wooden train that waited, puffing, dirty-in-the-dark, smelling of coal&#x2014;waited to take us down the coast to South Carolina. Perhaps it was because of the dilapidated old train that we brightened and became gay. Such a dingy, tired old relic could not help but provoke mirth. Someone pretended to have found a brass plate beneath one of the seats, and our car rocked with laughter as he read, &#x201c;This car is the property of the Philadelphia Museum of American History.&#x201d; We had light from kerosene lamps and heat from a potbellied stove. Draughts seemed to stream from every angle and there was a constant creaking and wailing of wood and wheels that sounded like an endless keening. Strange old train that it was, I loved it.<br><br>Comfort had been left behind in Washington. Some of us already were beginning to revel in the hardship of the train ride. That intangible mystique of the marine was somehow, even then, at work. We were having it rough, which is exactly what we expected and what we had signed up for. That is the thing: having it rough. The man who has had it roughest is the man to be most admired. Conversely, he who has had it the easiest is the least praiseworthy.<br><br>Those who wished to sleep could cat-nap on the floor while the train lurched down through Virginia and North Carolina. But these were few. The singing and the talk were too exciting.<br><br>The boy sitting next to me&#x2014;a handsome blond-haired youth from south Jersey&#x2014;turned out to have a fine high voice. He sang several songs alone. There being a liberal leavening of New York Irish among us, he was soon singing Irish ballads.<br><br>Across the aisle there was another boy, whom I shall call Armadillo because of his lean and pointed face. He was from New York and had attended college there. Being one of the few college men present, he had already established a sort of literary clique.<br><br>The Armadillo&#x2019;s coterie could not equal another circle farther down the car. This had at its center a stocky, smiling redhead. Red had been a catcher for the St. Louis Cardinals and had once hit a home run at the Polo Grounds off the great Carl Hubbell.<br><br>There was no measuring the impact of such a celebrity on our group, composed otherwise of mediocrities like myself. Red had been in the big time. He had held daily converse with men who were nothing less than the idols of his newfound comrades. It was quite natural they should ring him round; consult him on everything from pitching form to the Japanese General Staff.<br><br>&#x201c;Whaddya think it&#x2019;ll be like at Parris Island, Red?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hey, Red&#x2014;you think the Japs are as tough as the newspapers say they are?&#x201d;<br><br>It is an American weakness. The success becomes the sage. Scientists counsel on civil liberty; comedians and actresses lead political rallies; athletes tell us what brand of cigarette to smoke. But the redhead was equal to it. It was plain in his case what travel and headlines can do. He was easily the most poised of us all.<br><br>But I suspect even Red&#x2019;s savoir-faire got a rude jolt when we arrived in Parris Island. We had been taken from the railroad station by truck. When we had dismounted and had formed a motley rank in front of the red brick mess hall, we were subjected to the classic greeting.<br><br>&#x201c;Boys,&#x201d; said the sergeant who would be our drill instructor. &#x201c;Boys&#x2014;Ah want to tell yawl something. Give youah hearts to Jesus, boys&#x2014;cause youah ass belongs to me!&#x201d;<br><br>Then he fell us in after our clumsy civilian fashion and marched us into the mess hall.<br><br>There were baloney and lima beans. I had never eaten lima beans before, but I did this time; they were cold.<br><br>The group that had made the trip from New York did not survive the first day in Parris Island. I never saw the blond singer again, nor most of the others. Somehow sixty of us among the hundreds who had been aboard that ancient train, became a training platoon, were assigned a number and placed under the charge of the drill sergeant who had delivered the welcoming address.<br><br>Sergeant Bellow was a southerner with a fine contempt for northerners. It was not that he favored the southerners; he merely treated them less sarcastically. He was big. I would say six feet four inches, two hundred thirty pounds.<br><br>But above all he had a voice.<br><br>It pulsed with power as he counted the cadence, marching us from the administration building to the quartermaster&#x2019;s. It whipped us, this ragged remnant, and stiffened our slouching civilian backs. Nowhere else but in the Marine Corps do you hear that peculiar lilting cadence of command.<br><br>&#x201c;Thrip-faw-ya-leahft, thrip-faw-ya-leahft.&#x201d;<br><br>It sounds like an incantation; but it is merely the traditional &#x201c;three-four-your-left&#x201d; elongated by the southern drawl, made sprightly by being sung. I never heard it done better than by our sergeant. Because of this, and because of his inordinate love of drill, I have but one image of him: striding stiff-backed a few feet apart from us, arms thrust out, hands clenched, head canted back, with the whole body following and the great voice ceaselessly bellowing, &#x201c;Thrip-faw-ya-leahft, thrip-faw-ya-leahft.&#x201d;<br><br>Sergeant Bellow marched us to the quartermaster&#x2019;s. It was there we were stripped of all vestiges of personality. It is the quartermasters who make soldiers, sailors and marines. In their presence, one strips down.

To celebrate this outstanding career Grub Street is delighted to be publishing his new title La Cuisine des 5 Saisons in English. This beautiful book is about his recipes and his work as a chef and for the first time makes his dishes accessible for home cooks. Why is it called Five Seasons? Five seasons because for chef Gagnaire there are five not four seasons; Spring, he says must be divided into two seasons because you don't have the same produce in March and in June. Thus the recipes in this book follow the rhythm of the seasons and their bounty. In each chapter there are six menus with starter, main dish and dessert. The recipes come from Pierre Gagnaire's culinary repertory and these are the recipes which made him famous. Through the recipes one can see the strong worldwide influence in Pierre Gagnaire's cuisine, cooking with every kind of ingredient. His eponymous restaurant at 6 rue Balzac in Paris (in the 8th arrondissement) specializes in modern French cuisine, and has garnered three Michelin stars. He is an iconoclastic chef at the forefront of the fusion cuisine movement by introducing jarring juxtapositions of flavors, tastes, textures, and ingredients. On his website he gives his mission statement as &#x2018;facing tomorrow but respectful of yesterday&#x2019;. Gagnaire is also Head Chef of Sketch in London. In 2005 both restaurants were ranked in the S. Pellegrino World's 50 Best Restaurants by industry magazine Restaurant, with Pierre Gagnaire ranking third for three consecutive years (2006, 2007, and 2008). In December 2009, Gagnaire made his United States debut with Twist, a new flagship restaurant at the Mandarin Oriental in Las Vegas, which has since received great critical praise and a Forbes Five-Star Award. He now also has restaurants in Hong Kong, Seoul, Dubai, Tokyo, Berlin, and Moscow.</p><p></p><h2>I Saw You...: Comics Inspired by Real-Life Missed Connections</h2><p>This anthology of comics inspired by real-life missed connection ads posted on Craigslist and in local papers around the country will tug at your heartstrings <i>and</i> make you think. Lonely hearts, romantics, and even cynics pore over missed connection ads in search of love, to gawk and giggle, or out of curiosity. These posted stranger sightings and chance encounters lay bare the truths and oddities of real-life loneliness and attractions and bring out the voyeur in the best of us. <i>I Saw You</i> takes this phenomenon and makes it even better. <br><br>Julia Wertz has gathered the stars and soon-to-be-stars of the graphic art world, including Peter Bagge, Jesse Reklaw, Tom Hart, Sam Henderson, Laura Park, Emily Flake, Keith Knight, Janelle Hessig, Gabrielle Bell, Aaron Renier, Austin English, Corinne Mucha, Jeffrey Brown, Alec Longstreth, Minty Lewis, Joey Sayers, David Malki, Kazimir Strzepek, Ken Dahl, Shannon Wheeler, Shaenon Garrity, Rodd Perry, Abby Denson, Damien Jay, Sarah Glidden, and dozens more, to interpret these plaintive, hopeful postings in drawings that range from laugh-out-loud funny to disarmingly strange.</p><p>JULIA WERTZ is a cartoonist and writer and the creator of the autobiographical comic <i>The Fart Party.</i> She lives in Brooklyn.It seems like a simple enough premise: short comics based on the missed-connections ads from newspapers and Craigslist, drawn by a host of cartoonists. Despite thematically arranged chapters (coffee shops, travel), this anthology doesn't quite hang together&#x2014;in part because the contributors have interpreted the assignment in so many different ways. Some draw literal or metaphorical interpretations of actual ads; some make up their own; some mock the entire concept; a few simply address the idea of missed connections but don't deal with personal ads. The book's real value is as a snapshot of the current state of the mini-comics scene, in which editor Wertz is something of a star. Nearly every significant mini-comics artist of the moment is represented here, including Lucy Knisley, Kazimir Strzepek, Sarah Glidden, Alec Longstreth, and, best of all, Laura Park, who contributes a few splendid, cruelly funny pieces. There are a few bigger names in the collection (like Peter Bagge and Jeffrey Brown), but the roster will probably look a lot more impressive in a few years. <i>(Feb.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

During an era in which steam propulsion was still in its infancy, many of these historic illustrations depict the tentative crossover to the new technology, incoporating the fine lines and slender hull shape of the traditional sailing vessel with the power of the new engines. While steam was intended to be the main source of motive power, the addition of sails provided an alternative and trusted method of propulsion should this "new-fangled" steam engine fail to live up to its expectations. </p><p> Edwin Harland was known in his day as an innovative and daring ship designer and his flair for elegance as well as strength is apparent throughout this riveting history. The construction of these ships provides as much in the way of safety, utility and comfort as it does to aesthetics. </p><p> This unique account is both a fascinating and historic document and a superb expression of the shipbuilder's love of seagoing craft, and his exquisite skill in designing such refined ships to the most precise specifications. </p><p> Lavishly illustrated, this highly informative work contains over 175 color illustrations.</p></p><p></p><h2>The Ghost Writer</h2><p><b>The Ghost Writer</b> introduces Nathan Zuckerman in the 1950s, a budding writer infatuated with the Great Books, discovering the contradictory claims of literature and experience while an overnight guest in the secluded New England farmhouse of his idol, E. I. Lonoff. <br><br>At Lonoff's, Zuckerman meets Amy Bellette, a haunting young woman of indeterminate foreign background who turns out to be a former student of Lonoff's and who may also have been his mistress. Zuckerman, with his active, youthful imagination, wonders if she could be the paradigmatic victim of Nazi persecution. If she were, it might change his life.<br><br>The first volume of the trilogy and epilogue <i>Zuckerman Bound</i>, <b>The Ghost Writer</b> is about the tensions between literature and life, artistic truthfulness and conventional decency&#x2014;and about those implacable practitioners who live with the consequences of sacrificing one for the other.</p><p>A middle-aged writer recalls his younger self. At 23, Nathan Zuckerman has had four stories published and a small, flattering <i>Saturday Review</i> up-and-coming-author profile (complete with a photo of him playing with his ex-girlfriend's cat), which he purports to scorn. As genuine and polite as he seems, Zuckerman has already hurt his family with his autobiographical art and ruined his relationship with adultery and honesty. Visiting his reclusive idol (famed for his "blend of sympathy and pitilessness") in the Berkshires, the writer watches himself watching himself and attempts to confront his work and life. Instead he finds himself turning reality into metafiction. A quote he happens upon from Henry James only complicates matters further: "We work in the dark--we do what we can--we give what we have. Our doubt is our passion and our passion is our task. The rest is the madness of art." Events, however, have their revenge, weaving more out of control than even he can anticipate or ask for. Philip Roth is the master of the uncomfortable, and his alter ego a connoisseur of self-involvement, self-loathing, and self-examination. ("Virtuous reader, if you think that after intercourse all animals are sad, try masturbating on the daybed in E. I. Lonoff's study and see how you feel when it's over.")"Roth's most controlled and elegant work...serious, intelligent, dramatic, acutely vivid, slyly and wickedly funny...seductive far beyond its brief efficiency." &#x2014;<i>Village Voice<br><br></i>"I had only to read the two opening sentences to realize that I was once again in the hands of a superbly endowed storyteller." &#x2014;Robert Towers, <i>The New York Review of Books</i><br><br>"Further evidence that Roth can do practically anything with fiction.

While their larger speedboat cousins were powered by aircraft engines and piloted exclusively by the wealthy, early runabouts&#39;with their more modest inboard and outboard engines were more accessible and yet every bit as stylish in all respects. Today, even &#34;low-end&#34; runabouts from the golden age, with their hallmark chrome accessories and lovingly polished wooden hulls, fetch handsome sums at classic boat shows around the world. Authors Duncan and Ballantyne feature, in exclusive color photography, many of the finest wooden powerboats still breaking the waves today. Historic black-and-white shots capture them in their heyday, along with the legends who led the way: Christopher Columbus Smith, Gar Wood, John Hacker, Nap Lisee, and other giants of industry.</p><p>Step back into the golden age of the American runabout, with the smell of varnish and leather, and the sight of glittering brightwork and deep-hued mahogany. This historical look at the origins and development of the runabout speedboat in America traces the growth of recreational power boating along with details about the boats that made the era so memorable. Learn about men like Chris Smith, Gar Wood, Horace Dodge and others whose search for speed served as catalysts for a new and popular pastime. Eventually, new materials and mass production brought the curtain down on this era of fast wooden boats, but they did not erase the artistry and innovation that the boats of this era represent.</p><h2>Georg Baselitz: The Heroes</h2><p>Georg Baselitz spent the formative years of his painting career in West Germany, where an early impetus behind his work was the question of the country&#x2019;s still-troubled national identity and the discontinuity of the self and society. Between 1965 and 1966, Baselitz created the masterworks in his monumental <i>Heroes</i> and <i>New Types</i> series. <i>Georg Baselitz: The Heroes</i> reproduces the series in full-color with close readings of the paintings with regard to their artistic style and historical context.<br> The paintings in <i>Georg Baselitz: The Heroes</i> reflect a deep ambivalence toward German culture during the time in which the young artist created the series. In these now-classic scenes, military characters are portrayed as fundamentally contradictory figures, wounded and with their fatigues in tatters, their failures engraved on tormented faces. These images contrast sharply with the economic and political success of postwar West Germany. At the same time, the series served as a forceful formulation of the artist&#x2019;s position in relation to society.<br> Reproducing the boldly outspoken series, <i>Georg Baselitz: The Heroes</i> collects the artist&#x2019;s earliest statements on the theme of growing up against the fractured landscape of postwar Germany, a theme that has continued to be developed and refined throughout the artist&#x2019;s remarkable body of work.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><p><b>Max Hollein </b>is director of the Schirn Kunsthalle, St�del Museum, and St�dtische Galerie Liebieghaus, all in Frankfurt.</p></p><h2>Camp Camp: Where Fantasy Island Meets Lord of the Flies</h2><p>Dear Former Campers,<br><br>Do you recall your glory days at summer camp as some of the best months of your life?

Time <br>In March 1985, Terry Anderson was swept up in the violent conflict of a turbulent era. At the mercy of Shiite captors for nearly seven years, he lived in chains, wondering fearfully if each day would be his last. But his spirit soared beyond captivity, and he never gave up. Nor did those who loved him. And now, a free man again, he tells the harrowing and poignant story of a hostage's survival and final triumph.<br><i>From the Paperback edition.</i></p><p>Abridged from the memoirs of Terry Anderson, the Associated Press correspondent held hostage by Muslim fundamentalists for almost seven years, Den of Lions is a harrowing tale of physical and psychological deprivation and hardship. This audio adaptation achieves added poignancy through the interwoven narration of Anderson himself and his wife, Madeleine. Though the text reflects a journalist&#39;s integrity to the facts, an undertone of complex and conflicting emotions makes this first-hand account of Anderson&#39;s ordeal powerful and keenly felt. Terry and Madeleine Anderson take their audience on a unique journey not only through the battles that raged in the streets of Beirut, but the battles that waged within themselves as well. R.W.B. (c)AudioFile, Portland, MaineTremendously moving account by the AP's former Chief Middle East Correspondent of his 2,454 days as a hostage of the Islamic terrorist organization Hezbollah. Anderson's memoir comes fast after fellow hostage Brian Keenan's An Evil Cradling (p. 838) and complements it superbly. (A third hostage memoir, Terry Waite's Taken on Trust, is due out from Harcourt Brace in October but with no advance galleys.) Anderson shares neither Keenan's word-mastery nor his relentless focus on what goes on inside the hostage's cell, heart, and mind (Anderson's major attempts here at introspection, free-form poems that dot his text, are best overlooked). But the ex-reporter's plain and simple narration still packs a wallop and offers much deeper background on political maneuvers surrounding the hostage drama (including Oliver North and Ronald Reagan's respective roles)--with this background complemented by italicized reminiscences from Anderson's then- fiancee, Madeline Bassil. Anderson is also more frank than Keenan about the fluctuating condition of his fellow hostages (who for a time included Keenan himself), especially about squabbles (with up to five men chained into a tiny room, feuds sometimes lasted for weeks), as well as the madness that afflicted American hostage Frank Reed. Otherwise, the memoir at hand much parallels Keenan's: a litany of abuse, suffering, and despair; a paean to love, hope, and courage--which, in Anderson's case, finds its wrenching apexes on the day when Terry Waite, after four years in solitary, is led into Anderson's group of hostages; and on the day when Anderson, blindfolded, feels ``Someone [put] a hand on my shoulder'' and is told, `I'm a Syrian colonel. You're free.' '' That a man can spend seven years chained to a wall and less than two years later write such a lucid and compassionate memoir of his ordeal is a remarkable testament to humanity--as well as an unimpeachable indictment of the terrorism that chained his body but not his spirit.

At the same time, the grammatical and typographical landscape was shifting in tandem, away from objects and Things (and capitalized common Nouns) to the spaces in between, like punctuation and the &#x201c;lesser parts of speech&#x201d;. The implications for narrative included new patterns of syntactical architecture and the phenomenon of free indirect discourse. Wall examines the work of landscape theorists such as Repton, John Claudius Loudon, and Thomas Whately alongside travel narratives, topographical views, printers&#x2019; manuals, dictionaries, encyclopedias, grammars, and the novels of Defoe, Richardson, Burney, Radcliffe, and Austen to reveal a new landscaping across disciplines&#x2014;new grammars of approach in ways of perceiving and representing the world in both word and image.</p><p><b>Cynthia Wall </b>is professor of English at the University of Virginia. She is an editor of works by Bunyan, Defoe, and Pope, and the author of <i>The Literary and Cultural Spaces of Restoration London</i> and <i>The Prose of Things: Transformations of Description in the Eighteenth Century</i>, the latter also published by the University of Chicago Press.<br> &nbsp;&#x201c;<i>Grammars of Approach</i> is the best kind of literary history. Wall combines capacious knowledge of the eighteenth century with an entirely original understanding of the ways in which thinkers in the period described a redistributed perceptual field&#x2014;one in which landscape gardening, accounts of grammar and composition, architecture, and narrative all began to perceive and describe a newly important middle distance. Wall&#x2019;s generous conception of the notion of the approach illuminates the novel&#x2019;s role in dispatching abstract personification and replacing it with an expansive sense of physical space that can be occupied by multiple perspectives.&#x201d; (Frances Ferguson, University of Chicago)<br><br>&#x201c;This is a stunningly original book. It&#x2019;s a stroke of genius to link together these three modes of reading&#x2014;reading a landscape, reading language, and reading the physical appearance of a page. All obey (or break) rules of grammar through their use of space and punctuation; scale and focus; the direct, the meandering, the oblique, the carefully signaled emphasis. In <i>Grammars of Approach</i>, Cynthia Wall significantly expands how we think about form and visuality.&#x201d; (Kate Flint, University of Southern California)<br><br>&#x201c;Cynthia Wall provides a wealth of new evidence for the notion that writing and architecture have comparable and interrelated ways of producing meaning. This elegantly written work will serve as a reference for all those interested in the interdisciplinarity of eighteenth-century cultural forms.&#x201d; (David Spurr, author of Architecture and Modern Literature)<br><br>"At once oblique and straightforward, suggestive and&nbsp;pellucid, this book realizes a fundamentally ethical project as it&nbsp;brings humble, hardworking things into the foreground&#x2014;grammar&nbsp;books and prepositional phrases whose job it is to uphold,&nbsp;unpraised and invisible, the perceptual possibilities of any English&nbsp;sentence. Here, reading is 'three-dimensional' and perpetually&nbsp;generative, and the conditions of these possibilities are visible&nbsp;in Wall&#x2019;s signature combination of wit, imagination, erudition,&nbsp;and meticulous attention to what goes unnoticed by everybody&nbsp;else. . . .&nbsp;The moral? We do have a future. Wall and her fellow travelers&nbsp;teach us how we might best approach it, and at long last find&nbsp;ourselves at home."<br><br> &nbsp; (Jayne Lewis <i>SEL Studies in English Literature 1500-1900</i>)</p><h2>New Meanings for Ancient Texts: Recent Approaches to Biblical Criticisms and Their Applications</h2><p><p>This book is a supplement and sequel to <i>To Each Its Own Meaning</i>, edited by Steven L.

Given as a Christmas gift to a young boy, the Velveteen Rabbit lives in the nursery with all of the other toys, waiting for the day when the Boy (as he is called) will choose him as a playmate. In time, the shy Rabbit befriends the tattered Skin Horse, the wisest resident of the nursery, who reveals the goal of all nursery toys: to be made "real" through the love of a human. "'Real isn't how you are made,' said the Skin Horse. 'It's a thing that happens to you. When a child loves you for a long, long time, not just to play with, but REALLY loves you, then you become Real.'" This sentimental classic--perfect for any child who's ever thought that maybe, just <i>maybe</i>, his or her toys have feelings--has been charming children since its first publication in 1922. <i>(A great read-aloud for all ages, but children ages 8 and up can read it on their own.)</i><p>Celebrate the Easter season with <i>The Velveteen Rabbit,</i> one of the most beloved of bunnies, as he celebrates his 75th anniversary!

In this inspirational and uniquely personal tribute, the essential part played by black servicemen and -women in that cataclysmic conflict is brought home. <br><br>Here are letters, photographs, oral histories, and rare documents, collected by historian Christopher Moore, the son of two black WWII veterans. Weaving his family history with that of his people and nation, Moore has created an unforgettable tapestry of sacrifice, fortitude, and courage. From the 1,800 black soldiers who landed at Normandy Beach on D-Day, and the legendary Tuskegee Airmen who won ninety-five Distinguished Flying Crosses, to the 761st Tank Battalion who, under General Patton, helped liberate Nazi death camps, the invaluable effort of black Americans to defend democracy is captured in word and image.<br><br>Readers will be introduced to many unheralded heroes who helped America win the war, including Dorie Miller, the messman who manned a machine gun and downed four Japanese planes; Robert Brooks, the first American to die in armored battle; Lt. Jackie Robinson, the future baseball legend who faced court-martial for refusing to sit in the back of a military bus; an until now forgotten African-American philosopher who helped save many lives at a Japanese POW camp; even the author&#x2019;s own parents: his mother, Kay, a WAC when she met his father, Bill, who was part of the celebrated Red Ball Express.<br><br>Yet <i>Fighting for America</i> is more than a testimonial; it is also a troubling story of profound contradictions, of a country still in the throes of segregation, of a domestic battleground where arrests and riots occurred simultaneously with foreign service&#x2013;and of how the war helped spotlight this disparity and galvanize the need for civil rights. Featuring a unique perspective on black soldiers, <i>Fighting for America</i> will move any reader: all who, like the author, owe their lives to those who served.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER MOORE is curator and research historian for the New York Public Library&#x2019;s world-renowned Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture.

Ambrose had served as consultant on the movie, and <br>so I asked him why black soldiers had been left out of the D-Day <br>invasion. He told me he had provided the filmmakers with information <br>about several hundred blacks at Utah and Omaha Beach on D-Day, but that the story was taken in a &#x201c;different direction.&#x201d; Among the ablest historians of World War II, Ambrose believed that racism was at the heart of Nazi philosophy, and that its arteries extended to many nations, including our own. He assured me that military historians were taking a fresh look at the subject and that Americans would come to learn and appreciate more about the contributions of African-American soldiers throughout American history.<br><br>Black Soldiers and American Freedom<br><br>On the night of March 5, 1770, Crispus Attucks, a free black <br>dockworker, marched together with fifty laborers and sailors into a <br>dangerous confrontation with British soldiers, whose presence in Boston <br>was sharply resented. The soldiers fired into the crowd and Attucks <br>fell instantly, becoming the first of five men to die that night. <br>American patriots hailed Attucks&#x2019;s heroism and declared the Boston <br>Massacre the event that sparked the American Revolution.<br><br>In January 1776, Gen. George Washington finally lifted a prohibition <br>against black enlistment in the Continental Army, thus opening the <br>ranks to free black men. Some colonies also allowed slaves to win their <br>freedom by serving the American forces. Between 5,000 and 8,000 blacks <br>fought for the patriot cause. At the climactic Battle of Yorktown, <br>about a quarter of Washington&#x2019;s Continental Army was made up of black <br>soldiers. More than 10,000 enslaved men, women, and children also <br>provided labor for the Americans, transporting munitions, provisions, <br>and constructing fortifications and barricades in the Thirteen <br>Colonies. Interestingly, many enslaved Americans took advantage of a <br>British offer of freedom in return for military service, and more than <br>20,000 slaves fought and labored for the British side during the war.<br><br>By the time of the War of 1812, federal law restricted militia service <br>to &#x201c;free and able-bodied white citizens,&#x201d; and the U.S. Army and Marine <br>Corps did not permit blacks to enlist. Although free blacks and slaves <br>did fill support roles as laborers and teamsters in army camps, the <br>navy was the only service that officially admitted blacks in a fighting <br>capacity. Black troops served at the Battle of Lake Erie and at the <br>Battle of New Orleans, under the command of Gen. Andrew Jackson, <br>although they were excluded from later parades commemorating the New <br>Orleans victory.<br><br> From the opening salvo of the Civil War, thousands of free blacks and <br>fugitive slaves volunteered for the Union Army, only to be denied <br>service by President Lincoln, who maintained that the war was being <br>fought to restore the Union, not to end slavery. Believing the war <br>would be short-lived and the Union successfully restored, Lincoln <br>prohibited black soldiers from the Union ranks in order to avoid <br>angering his own border states, Delaware, Kentucky, Maryland, and <br>Missouri, where slavery was still protected by the Constitution.<br><br>However, as the war dragged on, President Lincoln&#x2019;s slavery policy (or <br>strategy) changed profoundly. On September 22, 1862, he issued a <br>preliminary Emancipation Proclamation, which effectively warned that if <br>the South did not end its rebellion within 100 days (by January 1, <br>1863) all slaves in the South were to be freed. The edict also <br>permitted former slaves and northern blacks to enter the armed <br>services.<br><br>On July 18, 1863, the Massachusetts 54th, the first all-black regiment <br>organized in the North, fought courageously during an attack on Fort <br>Wagner in South Carolina. Though underpaid and often assigned hard <br>labor, black men signed up by the thousands. Volunteers from South <br>Carolina, Tennessee, and Massachusetts filled the first authorized <br>black regiments. By the end of the Civil War, about 179,000 black men <br>served as soldiers in the Union army (comprising 10 percent of that <br>force), and another 19,000 served in the navy.<br><br>On April 9, 1865, at the Appomattox Court House, twelve &#x201c;colored&#x201d; <br>regiments, or about 3,500 black soldiers, stood guard outside along <br>with white Union soldiers as Gen. Robert E. Lee surrendered to Gen. <br>Ulysses S. Grant. About 38,000 black soldiers died during the war. With <br>nearly eighty black commissioned officers, black soldiers served in <br>artillery and infantry and performed support functions that sustained <br>the army. Black carpenters, blacksmiths, cooks, laborers, teamsters, <br>nurses, scouts, spies, steamboat pilots, and surgeons also contributed <br>to the war cause. Black women, who were not formally allowed to join <br>the army, served as nurses, spies, and scouts&#x2013;among them, Harriet <br>Tubman, the Union&#x2019;s most famous scout.<br><br>Buffalo Soldiers<br><br>So impressed were American military commanders by the bravery and valor of the Union&#x2019;s black soldiers that in July of 1866, the first black post&#x2014;Civil War regiments came into existence by an act of Congress, approved by President Andrew Johnson. By April 1867, six regiments of African-American soldiers were recruited into the regular peacetime army. Many were veteran United States Colored Troops from the Civil War, but among them were also newly freed slaves who wanted to serve <br>their country. Organized as the 9th and 10th Cavalry and the 38th through 41st Infantries, each regiment consisted of approximately a thousand men. In 1869 the infantry regiments were consolidated into two, the 24th and 25th. All four regiments&#x2013;two of cavalry and two of infantry&#x2013;were sent to the western frontier to fight in the Indian wars.<br><br>In the winter of 1867&#x2014;68, the newly formed 9th and 10th Cavalries were <br>engaged in Gen. Philip Sheridan&#x2019;s campaign against the native Comanche, <br>Kiowa, and Cheyenne in Texas and the western Oklahoma Territory. In the cold, harsh winters, the black soldiers wore coats made of buffalo hides. On account of the appearance of those coats and their own tightly curled hair, the Indians called them the &#x201c;Buffalo Soldiers.&#x201d; According to legend, it was the fighting spirit of the black soldiers that reminded the Native Americans of the bison, and the soldiers accepted the name as a term of honor and respect. About twenty years later, when designs for regimental coats of arms were being prepared, the 9th Cavalry adopted a galloping Indian-on-a-pony as its emblem, and &#x201c;We Can, We Will&#x201d; as its motto. The 10th Cavalry took the buffalo as its crest, and &#x201c;Ready and Forward&#x201d; became its motto.<br><br>Their duties were not limited to fighting. Known as &#x201c;guardian angels,&#x201d; <br>the Buffalo Soldiers protected frontier towns and farms, wagon trains, <br>stagecoaches, and Pony Express riders. Guarding railroad work crews and <br>cattle herds, the black troops also built and repaired frontier forts <br>and outposts. Stringing hundreds of miles of telegraph lines, they <br>explored and mapped vast areas of the Southwest, and helped develop the <br>early national parks. In garrison, the Buffalo Soldiers drilled, stood <br>guard, and maintained horses, weapons, and equipment. Serving <br>fifty-nine forts of the Old West, the black regiments developed into <br>four of the most distinguished fighting units in the army during the <br>remainder of the nineteenth century. Though completely overlooked in <br>Hollywood&#x2019;s glamorization of the cavalry-to-the-rescue myth, black <br>soldiers made up over 20 percent of the cavalry engaged in the Indian <br>wars, fighting in 85 percent of the Indian battles.<br><br>In 1877, Henry O. Flipper became the first African American to graduate <br>from the United States Military Academy at West Point. Promoted to lead <br>a 10th Cavalry unit, he saw his promising career ended in 1881 with a <br>dishonorable discharge. His commanding officer had charged him with <br>embezzling $3,791.77 from commissary funds. Flipper denied the charge, <br>claiming he was framed by white officers who disliked him because of <br>his color. A court-martial cleared Flipper of the embezzlement charge <br>but convicted him of conduct unbecoming of an officer and ordered him <br>dismissed from the army. He died in 1940 without vindication. In 1976 <br>the U.S. Army changed his discharge to honorable and a pardon issued by <br>President Bill Clinton in 1999 completely cleared Flipper&#x2019;s name.<br><br>On the seas, Capt. Michael A. Healy, the highest-ranking black officer <br>in the Revenue Cutter Service (precursor to the U.S. Coast Guard) <br>commanded the cutter Bear from 1887 to 1895. In charge of patrolling <br>Pacific waters from San Francisco to the Aleutian Islands, Captain <br>Healy was considered by many the best sailor of the North Pacific. <br>Commended by the U.S. Congress for his seafaring skills, an article in <br>the January 28, 1884, New York Sun termed the black captain among the <br>world&#x2019;s best seamen: &#x201c;Captain Mike Healy is a good deal more <br>distinguished person in the waters of the far Northwest than any <br>president of the United States or any potentate in Europe has yet <br>become.&#x201d;<br><br>By the 1890s, Native Americans had been defeated and confined to <br>reservations. On February 15, 1898, the battleship Maine exploded in <br>Havana harbor and twenty-two Buffalo Soldiers were among the 266 <br>fatalities. Again, the U.S. Army&#x2019;s four black regiments were sent to <br>war, distinguishing themselves in the ten-month-long Cuban campaign.

But he soon realizes that they are simply remnants of a once-great culture - now weak and living in terror of the sinister Morlocks lurking in the deep tunnels, who threaten his very return home. H. G. Wells defined much of modern science fiction with this 1895 tale of time travel, which questions humanity, society, and our place on Earth.

All rights reserved.In The Time Machine Wells pioneers the concept of travel in the &#39;Fourth Dimension&#39; and speculates about the ultimate decay of the human species. The world of the effete Eloi and ape-like Morlocks, the age of giant crabs, and the final portrayal of the heat-death of the sun constitute an unforgettable vision of the future. The Time Traveller&#39;s narrow escape from the remote descendants of humanity is paralleled by Edward Prendick&#39;s horrifying adventures among the Beast Folk of The Island of Doctor Moreau. Moreau, a ruthless vivisector, chooses an uninhabited Pacific island for his attempts to change animals into human beings on the operating table. Prendick soon fears that he, too, may become a victim of Moreau&#39;s experiments. Even at their most bleakly pessimistic and ironic, these stories testify to the resources of human courage and ingenuity. This edition offers authoritative texts of both novels, explanatory notes, and an introduction setting them in the context of Wells&#39;s life and thought.</p><h2>My Love Affair with England: A Traveler&#39;s Memoir</h2><p>Journalist and memoirist Susan Allen Toth brings her special England vivdly to life as she recalls her many trips there over the years, where she explored the countryside, traveled both second-class and in luxury, theatre-hopped, hunted for ghosts, and honeymooned. Humorous, bittersweet, and wonderfully eccentric, this is a delightful remembrance to be savored by those who love to travel or just dream of it.<br>"I love MY LOVE AFFAIR WITH ENGLAND. It is written clearly and with a understanding that far supasses any feeling of condescension or superiority or general quaintness among the natives, all of which I detect in books about other countries."<br>M.F.K. Fisher</p><p>Susan Allen Toth is currently a professor of English at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota.Toth ( Blooming ) makes no apologies here for her lack of authority about English history or current affairs; she is not ashamed to admit that she has ventured little beyond literary London and England's most picturesque locales; and she disdains what she calls the "Bleak Chic"11 school of British travel writing. But then, this is not a travel memoir in the modern sense, fashioned for hardened realists. Without a trace of irony, Toth writes of the "lure of England's many-layered past"23 and the reverence felt by every English major, present or former, when walking down streets well known to Dickens. She is spot-on in explaining why English marmalade tastes good only when eaten as part of a real English breakfast--"the tangy flavor puts just the right edge on a slathery, swimming-in-fat breakfast of bacon, sausage and fried eggs."73 Toth's descriptive powers and her almost Victorian sense of sentiment occasionally wear thin, especially in the sections where she deals with her recent visits. But she is in top form when she recounts her travels as a Smith student in 1960 and 10 years later as a harried guide for touring students. At these and many other points, the book feels wonderfully cozy--the print equivalent of a nice cup of tea. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Siege of Castellax (10) (Space Marine Battles)</h2><p>CL Werner makes his 40K debut with the latest Space Marine Battles novel<br><br>The Chaos Space Marines of the Iron Warriors Legion, long renowned as the masters of siege warfare, find the tables turned as they become the target of a massive ork invasion.</p><p>The blazing wastelands of Arizona, home to rattlesnakes, gila monsters, and other unpleasant reptiles such as C.

In the meantime the village has been bombed by the Russian army, and Dastaguir, with his newly-deaf grandson Yassin in tow, must reach Murad to tell him of the carnage. The old man is beset on all sides by sorrow, that of his grandson, who cannot understand, that of his son, who does not yet know, and his own, made even crueler by the message he must deliver. <br>&nbsp;<br>Atiq Rahimi, whose reputation for writing war stories of immense drama and intimacy began with this, his first novel, has managed to condense centuries of Afghan history into a short tale of three very different generations. But he has also created a universal story about fathers and sons, and the terrible strain inflicted on those bonds of family during the unpredictable carnage of war.</p><p>Born in Kabul in 1962, Atiq Rahimi was seventeen years old when the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan. He fled to Pakistan during the war and eventually applied and was granted political asylum in France in 1984. Studying at the Sorbonne, he received a doctorate in audio-visual communications. After the fall of the Taliban in 2002, Rahimi returned to Afghanistan where he filmed an adaptation of <i>Earth and Ashes</i>. There he has become renowned as a maker of documentary and feature films, and as a writer. The film of <i>Earth and Ashes</i> was in the Official Selection at Cannes in 2004 and won a number of prizes. Since 2001 Rahimi has returned to Afghanistan a number of times to set up a Writers' House in Kabul and offer support and training to young. His novel <i>The Patience Stone</i> (Other Press) won the Prix Goncourt in 2008."I'm hungry." <br> <br>You take an apple from the scarf you've tied into a bundle and wipe it on your dusty shirt. The apple just gets dirtier. You put it back in the bundle and pull out another, cleaner one, which you give to your grandson, Yassin, who is sitting next to you, his head resting on your tired arm. The child takes it in his small, dirty hands and brings it to his mouth. His front teeth haven't come through yet. He tries to bite with his canines. His hollow, chapped cheeks twitch. His narrow eyes become narrower. The apple is sour. He wrinkles up his small nose and gasps. <br> <br>With your back to the autumn sun, you are squatting against the iron railings of the bridge that links the two banks of the dry riverbed north of Pul-i-Khumri. The road connecting Northern Afghanistan to Kabul passes over this very bridge. If you turn left on the far side of the bridge, onto the dirt track that winds between the scrub-covered hills, you arrive at the Karkar coal mine.... <br> <br>The sound of Yassin whimpering tears your thoughts away from the mine. Look, your grandson can't bite the apple. Where's that knife? You search your pockets and find it. Taking the apple from his hands, you cut it in half, then in half again, and hand the pieces back to him. You put the knife in a pocket and fold your arms over your chest. <br> <br>You haven't had any naswar for a while. Where's the tin? You search your pockets again. Eventually you find it and put a pinch of naswar in your mouth. Before returning the tin to your pocket, you glance at your reflection in its mirrored lid. Your narrow eyes are set deep in their sockets. Time has left its mark on the surrounding skin, a web of sinuous lines like thirsty worms waiting around a hole. The turban on your head is unraveling. Its weight forces your head into your shoulders. It is covered with dust. Maybe it's the dust that makes it so heavy. Its original color is no longer apparent. The sun and the dust have turned it gray... <br> <br>Put the box back. Think of something else. Look at something else. <br> <br>You put the tin back into one of your pockets. You draw your hand over your gray-streaked beard, then clasp your knees and stare at your tired shadow which merges with the orderly shadows cast by the railings of the bridge. <br> <br>An army truck, a red star on its door, passes over the bridge. It disturbs the stony sleep of the dry earth. The dust rises. It engulfs the bridge then settles. Silently it covers everything, dusting the apples, your turban, your eyelids...You put your hand over Yassin's apple to shield it. <br> <br>"Don't!" your grandson shouts. Your hand prevents him from eating. <br> <br>"You want to eat dust, child?" <br> <br>"Don't!" <br> <br>Leave him alone. Keep yourself to yourself. The dust fills your mouth and nostrils. You spit your naswar out next to five other small green plugs on the ground. With the loose flap of your turban, you cover your nose and mouth. You look over at the far end of the bridge, at the road to the mine. At the black wooden hut of the guard posted at the road barrier. Wisps of smoke fly from its little window. A few seconds of indecision and then you grip one of the bridge's rusty railings with one hand and grab your bundle with the other. Pulling yourself to your feet, you shuffle in the direction of the hut. Yassin gets up too and follows you, clinging to your shirt. Together you approach the hut. You put your head through the small, paneless window. The hut is full of smoke. There's the smell of coal. The guard is in exactly the same position as he was before, his back against one of the walls, his eyes still closed. His cap might have been pulled slightly further down, but that's all. Everything else is just the same, even the half-smoked cigarette between his dry lips... <br> <br>Try coughing. <br> <br>Even you can't hear your cough, let alone the guard. Cough again, a bit louder. He doesn't hear that either. Let's hope the smoke hasn't suffocated him. You call out. <br> <br>"Brother..." <br> <br>"What do you want now, old man?" <br> <br>He can speak, thank goodness. He's alive. But he's still motionless, his eyes closed under his cap...Your tongue moves, preparing to say something. Don't interrupt him! <br> <br>"...You're killing me. I told you a hundred times. When a car comes past, I'll throw myself in its path, I'll beg them to take you to the mine. What else do you want? Till now have you seen any cars? No? You want someone else's word?" <br> <br>"I wouldn't dream of it, my good brother. I know there's been no car. But you never know...what if you were to forget us..." <br> <br>"How on earth do you expect me to forget, old man? If you want I can recite your life story. You told it to me enough times. Your son works at the mine, you are here with his son to see him." <br> <br>"My God, you remember everything...It's me who's losing my memory. I thought I hadn't told you. Sometimes I think others forget the way I do. I'm sorry. I've bothered you..." <br> <br>The truth is, your heart is burdened. It's been a long time since a friend or even a stranger listened to you. A long time since a friend or stranger warmed your heart with their words. You want to talk and to listen. Go on, speak to him. But you're unlikely to get a response. The guard won't listen to you. He is deep in his own thoughts. Preoccupied with himself. Let him be. <br> <br>You stand silently in front of the hut, gazing away from it at the pitch and roll of the valley. The valley is dried out, covered in thorn bushes-silent. And at the end of the valley is Murad, your son. <br> <br>You turn away from the valley and stare back inside the hut. You want to tell the guard that you're only waiting here like this for a vehicle to pass because of your grandson Yassin. If you were alone, you'd have set out on foot a long time ago. For you, walking four or five hours is nothing. Each and every day you're on your feet working for ten hours, or longer, working your land. You're a courageous man...So what? Why tell the guard all this? What's it to him? Nothing. Then let him be. Sleep in peace, brother...We're off. We won't bother you again. <br> <br>But you don't go. You stand there quietly. <br> <br>The click of colliding stones at your feet draws your attention to Yassin. He is squatting down, crushing a piece of apple between two stones. <br> <br>"What are you doing? For God's sake! Eat your apple!" <br> <br>You grab Yassin by the shoulders and pull him to his feet. The child shouts: <br> <br>"Don't! Let me go...Why don't these stones make any noise?" <br> <br>The smell of smoke escaping from the hut mingles with the roar of the guard's voice: <br> <br>"You're killing me! Can't you keep your grandson quiet for one minute?" <br> <br>You don't have the chance to apologize, or rather, you can't face it. You take hold of Yassin's hand and drag him to the bridge. You drop back down to the ground against the iron railings, put the bundle by your side and, wrapping your arms around the little boy, scold him: <br> <br>"Will you behave!" <br> <br>To whom are you speaking? To Yassin? He can't even hear the sound of stones, let alone your feeble voice. Yassin's world is now another world, one of silence. He wasn't deaf. He became deaf. He doesn't realize this. He's surprised that nothing makes a sound anymore. Until a few days ago it wasn't this way. <br> <br>Just imagine. You're a child, Yassin, who heard perfectly well just a short time ago, a child who didn't even know what "deafness" was. And then, one day, suddenly you can't hear a sound. Why? It would be foolish to try to tell you it was deafness. You don't hear, you don't understand. You don't think it's you who can't hear; you think others have become mute. People have lost their voices; stones have lost their sound. The world is silent...So then, why are people moving their mouths? <br> <br>Yassin hides his small, question-filled face under your shirt. <br> <br>Your gaze is drawn over the side of the bridge, to the dried-up river that has become a bed of black stones and scrub. You look above the riverbed to the rocky mountains in the distance. They merge with Murad's face. <br> <br>"Why have you come, father? Is everything all right?" he asks. <br> <br>For more than a week now, this face with this question has haunted your days and your nights. <br> <br>Why have you come? The question gnaws at your bones. Can't that brain in your head find an answer? If only there were no such question. No such word as "why." You've come to see how your son's doing. That's all. After all, you're a father, you think about your son from time to time. Is it a sin? No. You know why you've really come. <br> <br>You look for your box of naswar, tip a little into the palm of your hand, and put it under your tongue. If only things were simple, full of pleasure-like naswar, like sleep...Your gaze rises above the summits of the mountains to the sky...But Murad's face still mingles with the mountains. The rocks are slowly becoming hot; they're turning red. It is as if they have become coal, and the mountains are one great furnace. The coal catches fire, erupting from the mountain and flowing down the dry riverbed toward you. You are on one side of the river, Murad is on the other. Murad keeps asking, "Why have you come? Why have you come alone with Yassin? Why have you given Yassin silent stones?" <br> <br>Then Murad starts to cross over to you. <br> <br>"Murad," you shout, "stay where you are, child! It's a river of fire. You'll get burned! Don't come!" <br> <br>You ask yourself who could believe such a thing: a river of flowing fire? Have you become a seer of visions? Look, Murad is wading through the river without getting burned. No, he must be getting burned, but he's not reacting. Murad is strong. He doesn't break down. Look at him. His body is covered in sweat. <br> <br>"Murad," you shout again, "Stop! The river's on fire!" <br> <br>But Murad continues to move toward you, asking, "Why have you come? Why have you come?" <br> <br>From somewhere, you're not sure where, the voice of Murad's mother rises. <br> <br>"Dastaguir, tell him to stay there. You cross the river. Take my apple-blossom patterned scarf with you and go and wipe away his sweat.

Combining Surrealist influences with a love for old engravings, prolific designer Piero Fornasetti (1913-88) created an array of whimsical creations and visions. Applying these to items of daily use, his workshops issued decorated cups, ties, scarves, fans, and screens along with dazzling pieces of trompe l'oeil furniture, all now sought by collectors. In addition, Fornasetti created countless drawings, book designs, and portraits and designed the decor for the luxury liner Andrea Doria .

The book brings together for the first time a wealth of information on such topics as knighthood, military organization, weaponry and fortifications, and warfare in the East. In 1095 with the launching of the First Crusade, Europeans established a great military endeavour to save the Holy Land, an undertaking that remained a central preoccupation until the end of the thirteenth century. While the expeditions that went forth to fight the Muslims involved armies of exceptional size, much of the warfare within western Europe itself was conducted by small armies on behalf of landowners who were often neighbours and kin. <br>In his approach to his subject, John France considers political, social, and economic development in the age of the crusades. He emphasizes the significance of four factors in shaping medieval warfare: the dominance of land as a form of wealth, the limited competence of government, the state of technology that favoured defence over attack, and the geography and climate of western Europe. His coverage of the castle and the knight in armour depicts the role of landowners in producing these characteristic medieval instruments of war. In addition, France provides an extensive analysis of battles in which he reconstructs a series of encounters in superb detail.</p></p><p><p>JOHN FRANCE is Senior Lecturer in History at the University of Wales, Swansea. He is the author of Victory in the East: A Military History of the First Crusade.</p><p>"John France.... has produced a minor tour de force of synthesis and analysis of one of the central features of medieval life."</p> (Christopher Tyerman, Hertford College, Oxford. War in History. Vol. 7, No. 3, 212.)<br><br><p>"This is a valuable book packed with an extensive survey of recent studies by specialists, elucidated by rich notes, and complemented by a full bibliography... It is an excellent place to commence an examination of the subject, and specialists will also find it helpful in gaining a background for regions and periods other than their own."</p> (James F. Powers, College of the Holy Cross. Speculum, October 2000)<br><br><p>"France packs an impressive array of information into this authoritative study... The author provides enough detail (including examples of battles with maps) to make his book accessible to an educated audience."</p><br><br><p>"This book is clearly based on a considerable amount of detailed research and reading. It adopts, in the main, a thematic approach and covers not just the obvious topics, such as the recruitment of troops, sieges, and battles in the field: among the less familiar subjects treated are metallurgical developments, the provision of food supplies, transport, and the qualities demanded of a successful commander. Medieval warfare is also set in political, social, and economic context, with an examination of the causes and objectives of war."</p> (A.J. Forey, Emeritus, University of Dublin. American Historical Review. Spring 2000.)<br><br><p>"France, whose Victory in the East is undoubtedly the finest military history of the First Crusade, has turned here to a general study of the military history of Europe from1000 to 1300. Unique facts and novel ideas come to the reader at a furious pace, but with... clear footnotes and an ample bibliography. This book should lead students and researchers alike to fresh discussions of what it was like to fight wars during the Middle Ages."</p><br><br><p>"I am full of admiration for this excellent story of the practice of warfare in the Central Middle Ages. It is a work of both scholarship and synthesis, full of insight, and communicated in an accessible and professional way."</p> (Norman Housley, University of Leicester)<br><br><p>"This book contributes considerably to scholarship in this field.

He was captured and taken prisoner to the notorious Hong Kong death camp, Shamshuipo, where he was held from December 30,&nbsp;1941 to August 1945. His story is an extraordinary one of survival against all the odds,&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;a story of how a group of&nbsp;men worked together to improve conditions in the camp for their fellow prisoners. They were offered nothing by their captors but the constant command&nbsp;to "improvise," which they learned to do by recycling salvaged materials into everything from homemade nails, cooking pots, and plates, to surgical instruments, beds, and nesting boxes. His diary demonstrates how individuals can work together in an almost unimaginable adversity to improve life for their fellow people, and how imagination and innovation can flourish in even the worst conditions. This story is a model of care, humanity, and inventiveness.</p><p><b>Andrew Robertshaw</b>&nbsp;is a museum curator, military historian, author, and broadcaster.

Millions have lost their jobs, homes and healthcare while those who work watch their pensions, benefits and job security decline. As more and more are impacted by the crisis, the system continues to make the very wealthy even richer. In eye-opening interviews with prominent economist Richard Wolff, David Barsamian probes the root causes of the current economic crisis, its unjust social consequences, and what can and should be done to turn things around. While others blame corrupt bankers and unregulated speculators, the government, or even the poor who borrowed, the authors show that the causes of the crisis run much deeper. They reach back to the 1970s when the capitalist system itself shifted, ending the century-old pattern of rising wages for U.S. workers and thereby enabling the top 1% to become ultra-rich at the expense of the 99%. Since then, economic injustice has become chronic and further corrupted politics. The Occupy movement, by articulating deep indignation with the whole system, mobilizes huge numbers who seek basic change. <em>Occupying the Economy</em> not only clarifies and analyzes the crisis in U.S. capitalism today, it also points toward solutions that can shape a far better future for all.</p><p><strong>Richard D.

Wolff is author of the breakout book <em>Capitalism Hits the Fan</em>.</p><p>"Richard Wolff and David Barsamian truly understand, at the deepest levels, both the need for political, social, and economic change in this nation, and the ways such change can happen. This is an essential read for everybody concerned with the future of the world, from academics to concerned citizens, it's also a brilliant and thoughtful manual that every activist must own."&#x2014;Thom Hartmann, internationally syndicated radio/TV host, and author of <em>The Last Hours of Ancient Sunlight</em></p><p>"Occupy activists everywhere are heatedly debating the question, "What's next for our movement?' In his collected interviews with David Barsamian, radical economist Richard Wolff lays out a compelling framework for further anti-corporate organizing that focuses on the root of the problem: capitalism and its never-ending assault on the 99%. Occupiers (past, present, and future) now have an intellectual guide to a different kind of economy--one that's equitable, sustainable, and, let's hope, politically achievable, sooner rather than later.

He has won several Spur Awards, including one for <i>Sierra: A Novel of the California Gold Rush.</i></p><h2>The Aeneid of Virgil</h2><p>The Aeneid is the great national epic of ancient Rome, and one of the most important works of literature ever written. And with Professor Vandiver&#39;s twelve instructive lectures, you&#39;ll enter fully into the gripping tale that Virgil tells. Join Aeneas on his long journey west from ruined Troy to the founding of a new nation in Italy, and see how he weaves a rich network of compelling human themes. Your encounter with the Aeneid focuses on careful, detailed examinations of the epic&#39;s background, main themes, and significant episodes. You&#39;ll get a helpful introduction to Virgil&#39;s Latin epic and the mythic and literary background with which Virgil was working (including an insightful summary of the legends of the Trojan War and of Romulus and Remus). From there, you&#39;ll dive into the poem itself with lectures that, in their clarity, economy, and enthusiasm, you&#39;re sure to find illuminating and thoroughly engaging. Throughout it all, the figure of Aeneas is never far from center stage- as fighter and lover, father and son, refugee and ruler, wanderer and founder, spellbinding storyteller, and sword-wielding man of action. Whether you read the narrative of his adventures as a paean to the glories of Rome or a cautionary tale about the human costs of empire, by the end of these lectures you&#39;ll come to understand precisely why Tennyson called Virgil a lord of language, and lauded his special gift for golden phrase.</p><p></p><h2>Nonsense: The Power of Not Knowing</h2><p><b>An illuminating look at the surprising upside of ambiguity&#x2014;and how, properly harnessed, it can inspire learning, creativity, even empathy</b><br><b> &nbsp;</b><br> Life today feels more overwhelming and chaotic than ever. Whether it&#x2019;s a confounding work problem or a faltering relationship or an unclear medical diagnosis, we face constant uncertainty. And we&#x2019;re continually bombarded with information, much of it contradictory. <br> &nbsp;<br> Managing ambiguity&#x2014;in our jobs, our relationships, and daily lives&#x2014;is quickly becoming an essential skill. Yet most of us don&#x2019;t know where to begin.<br> &nbsp;<br> As Jamie Holmes shows in <i>Nonsense</i>, being confused is unpleasant, so we tend to shutter our minds as we grasp for meaning and stability, especially in stressful circumstances. We&#x2019;re hard-wired to resolve contradictions quickly and extinguish anomalies. This can be useful, of course. When a tiger is chasing you, you can&#x2019;t be indecisive. But as <i>Nonsense</i> reveals, our need for closure has its own dangers. It makes us stick to our first answer, which is not always the best, and it makes us search for meaning in the wrong places. When we latch onto fast and easy truths, we lose a vital opportunity to learn something new, solve a hard problem, or see the world from another perspective. <br> &nbsp;<br> In other words, confusion&#x2014;that uncomfortable mental place&#x2014;has a hidden upside. We just need to know how to use it. This lively and original book points the way.<br><br> Over the last few years, new insights from social psychology and cognitive science have deepened our understanding of the role of ambiguity in our lives and Holmes brings this research together for the first time, showing how we can use uncertainty to our advantage. Filled with illuminating stories&#x2014;from spy games and doomsday cults to Absolut Vodka&#x2019;s ad campaign and the creation of Mad Libs&#x2014;<i>Nonsense</i>&nbsp;promises to transform the way we conduct business, educate our children, and make decisions.<br> &nbsp;<br> In an increasingly unpredictable, complex world, it turns out that what matters most isn&#x2019;t IQ, willpower, or confidence in what we know. It&#x2019;s how we deal with what we don&#x2019;t understand.</p><p>Jamie Holmes is a Future Tense Fellow at New America and a former Research Coordinator at Harvard University in the Department of Economics. He holds an M.I.A. from Columbia&#x2019;s School of International and Public Affairs and his writing has appeared in <i>The</i>&nbsp;<i>New Yorker, </i>the<i> New York Times</i>,<i>&nbsp;Slate</i>, <i>Politico</i>, the <i>Christian Science Monitor</i>, <i>The New Republic</i>, <i>The Atlantic</i>, <i>Foreign Policy</i>, and the <i>Daily Beast</i>.<b>NONSENSE</b><br> <b>The Power of Not Knowing</b><br> by Jamie Holmes<br> &nbsp;<br> Prologue<br> &nbsp;<br> IN 1996, LONDON&#x2019;S City and Islington College organized a crash course in French for novices and below-average students. Paula, an earnest teenager wearing wire-rim glasses, had never spoken a word of the language before. Darminder, goateed and earringed, was not only new to French, but had also failed his Spanish General Certifi�cate of Secondary Education (GCSE). Abdul had failed his German GCSE. Satvinder and Maria had each flunked their French GCSEs, and Emily&#x2019;s French teacher was so unimpressed that she advised her to give up on the language entirely. Instead of abandoning all hope, however, the students had signed up for a unique opportunity. For five full days, they&#x2019;d submit to the eccentric methodology of a lin�guist named Michel Thomas.<br> &nbsp;<br> Gray-haired and wearing a blue blazer, Thomas radiated poise and grace. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m very pleased to meet you,&#x201d; he told his new students, &#x201c;and I&#x2019;m looking forward to teaching you today, but under better physical conditions, because I don&#x2019;t think that where you&#x2019;re sitting is very comfortable. I would like you to feel comfortable, so we&#x2019;re going to rearrange everything.&#x201d; In a truck outside, Thomas had stashed some unexpected replacements for the standard classroom furniture: armchairs, pillows, coffee tables, plants, a rug, a fan, and even wicker folding screens. With a little effort, the students completely trans�formed the room. Plush high-backed armchairs formed a half oval, the blue curtains had been drawn, the lights dimmed, and the wicker screens enclosed the armchairs and lent the space an even cozier and more intimate feel.<br> &nbsp;<br> There would be no desks, blackboards, paper, pens, or pencils. Thomas didn&#x2019;t want the students to read or write anything. He didn&#x2019;t want them to try to remember anything they studied either, or even review it at the end of the day. If, during class, they couldn&#x2019;t remem�ber something, he advised, it wasn&#x2019;t&nbsp;<i>their&nbsp;</i>problem. It was his. Emily looked incredulous. Darminder and Abdul couldn&#x2019;t contain their impish smiles. But none of the students could hide their genuine cu�riosity about the old man in front of them. Was he serious? Never&nbsp;<i>try&nbsp;</i>to remember anything taught in class?<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I want you to relax.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> This scene, Thomas&#x2019;s methods, and the results of those five days appeared in a BBC documentary titled&nbsp;<i>The Language Master.&nbsp;</i>Mar�garet Thompson, head of the French department at the school, was tasked with evaluating Thomas&#x2019;s results. At the end of the week, she watched as the students&#x2014;many of whom had never uttered a word of French before&#x2014;translated full sentences using advanced grammati�cal forms. Emily managed to interpret a phrase that would normally take years to tackle: &#x201c;I would like to know if you want to go see it with me tonight.&#x201d; Paula praised Thomas&#x2019;s strong emphasis on calm and patience. The students felt, they said, as though they&#x2019;d learned five years&#x2019; worth of French in only five days. Rather stunned by the outcome, Thompson bashfully deferred to their self-appraisal.<br> &nbsp;<br> Michel Thomas knew how intimidating it can be to explore a new language. Students face new pronunciations for familiar letters, words with novel meanings, missing parts of speech, and odd gram�matical structures. That&#x2019;s why the City and Islington students, de�spite the relaxed atmosphere, still exhibited the signs of confusion: nervous laughter, embarrassed smiles, muttered apologies, stutters, hesitations, and perplexed glances. Learning a foreign language re�quires you to journey into unfamiliar terrain. Thomas referred to a new language as the &#x201c;most alien thing&#x201d; one can learn. To fend off these &#x201c;alien&#x201d; intrusions, the mind instinctively erects barricades, and the teacher&#x2019;s first and often most difficult challenge is to help students pull these walls down. Thomas was able to transform the atmosphere in that City and Islington classroom from one of stress�ful apprehension to one of calm curiosity. He somehow instilled a greater open-mindedness in the students. Pupils who had habitually dismissed what they didn&#x2019;t yet grasp suddenly became more likely to venture out into the unknown.<br> &nbsp;<br> At the time of the BBC documentary, which aired in 1997, Thomas was already legendary. He&#x2019;d learned eleven languages, opened tu�toring centers in Los Angeles and New York, and built something of a cult following thanks to a client list that included Grace Kelly, Bob Dylan, Alfred Hitchcock, Coca-Cola, Procter &amp; Gamble, and American Express. Nigel Levy, who studied with Thomas before producing the BBC piece, characterized the lessons as &#x201c;astonishing.&#x201d; Emma Thompson described her time with him as &#x201c;the most extraor�dinary learning experience of my life.&#x201d; Israel&#x2019;s former ambassador to the United Nations called him &#x201c;a miracle worker.&#x201d; And Herbert Morris, a former dean of humanities at UCLA, confided that he&#x2019;d learned a year&#x2019;s worth of Spanish in just a few days with Thomas and remembered it nine months later.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The most important thing,&#x201d; Thomas said, was to &#x201c;eliminate all kinds of tension and anxiety&#x201d; that are associated with learning.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> His attention to mood was peculiar, even downright radical. He&#x2019;d often begin teaching French, for example, by telling his students that French and English share thousands of words. It&#x2019;s only that they sound a little different. &#x201c;English is French, badly pronounced,&#x201d; he once joked. Words ending in&nbsp;<i>-ible,&nbsp;</i>like&nbsp;<i>possible,&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>-able,&nbsp;</i>like&nbsp;<i>table,&nbsp;</i>all originate from French words, he&#x2019;d explain. Recasting the unknown as familiar, Thomas provided students, from the outset, with sturdy building blocks. His pupils grafted new knowledge onto existing knowledge, bit by bit, expressing their own thoughts and never re�iterating rote phrases. Thomas taught for autonomy and rarely cor�rected his students directly.<br> &nbsp;<br> By 2004, Thomas&#x2019;s French, German, Italian, and Spanish in�structional CDs and tapes&#x2014;recordings of Thomas teaching each subject to two students&#x2014;were the top-selling language courses in the United Kingdom. But Michel Thomas wasn&#x2019;t merely a linguist. He was also a war hero. That same year, he was honored at the World War II Memorial in Washington, DC, where he received the Silver Star. He died in 2005 in New York City, as an American citizen, but he was born in the industrial city of &#x141;�dz�, Poland, as Moniek Kros�kof. He&#x2019;d survived concentration camps, led troops, and worked as a spy and interrogator for the Allies, netting more than two thousand Nazi war criminals after the war. &#x201c;Michel Thomas&#x201d; was his fifth false identity and nom de guerre.<br> &nbsp;<br> Thomas&#x2019;s firsthand experience with totalitarian propaganda and his postwar undercover career are no mere biographical curiosities. His insights into the way our minds snap shut or unlock in the face of ambiguity&#x2014;the central concern of this book&#x2014;grew from his ex�periences in Germany. He had witnessed up close how Nazism had fostered a dismissive, even disdainful approach to uncertainty and moral complexity among its most fervent adherents. And he then spent decades developing methods to nurture a diametrically op�posed attitude among language learners. Fifty years before the BBC documentary, in fact, Thomas tested his early ideas in an episode that eerily inverts his pedagogical demonstration at City and Islington.<br> &nbsp;<br> *************<br> &nbsp;<br> IN 1946, RUDOLF Schelkmann&#x2014;formerly a major in the intel�ligence service of Hitler&#x2019;s SS&#x2014;was hiding in Ulm, Germany, co�ordinating a loose network of loyalists hell-bent on reestablishing Nazi rule. That November, Schelkmann and three other former SS officers had been baited into meeting the purported commander of a more powerful and centralized underground neo-Nazi resistance. In reality, they were about to meet Moniek Kroskof, aka Michel Thomas, a Polish-born Jew and undercover agent of the US Army&#x2019;s Counter Intelligence Corps (CIC).<br> &nbsp;<br> Tasked with bringing war criminals to justice, Thomas was on a mission to identify and eventually dismantle Schelkmann&#x2019;s net�work. Another CIC agent who went by the name of Hans Meyer had been carefully building a rapport with members of the network, but Schelkmann remained reticent. The former SS man had agreed to share contacts and operational details, but only after meeting face-to-face with Meyer&#x2019;s commander. Thomas had to keep Schelkmann and his men from smelling a rat. Toward that end, he had meticu�lously arranged for the SS conspirators to be run through a tortuous routine in the hours leading up to the big meeting.<br> &nbsp;<br> Earlier that night, the SS men had been waiting, on Meyer&#x2019;s or�ders, in a &#x201c;safe house&#x201d; southwest of Ulm. Without warning, motor�bikes arrived to pick them up. Thomas had deliberately waited for stormy weather; as the conspirators sat on the backs of the bikes, sharp winds pressed at the men&#x2019;s rain-soaked clothes. Dropped off on a deserted road, the conspirators were blindfolded and hustled into two cars. In the darkness, they heard passwords exchanged as they navigated a series of staged security checks. They were pulled from the cars, marched blindly down a muddy path, and led through deep, icy puddles. They were kept waiting in an unheated corridor and were forbidden to speak. Still blindfolded, they listened to terse commands, scurrying footsteps, and doors opening and closing hur�riedly. By the time Schelkmann and his men were finally led into a lodge hall and were allowed to see, it was past midnight.<br> &nbsp;<br> Thomas&#x2014;or Frundsberg to the SS men&#x2014;greeted the conspira�tors from behind a large desk. Wearing civilian clothes except for a brown, military-style shirt, he&#x2019;d been described to the Nazi loyalists as a former senior officer of the RSHA, an intelligence group once overseen by Himmler. Frundsberg&#x2019;s hunting lodge, as the faux head�quarters of the underground &#x201c;Grossorganisation&#x201d; resistance, was artfully embellished with portraits of Hitler and other Nazi bigwigs and decorated with grenades, machine guns, pistols, flame throwers, and sabotage kits. Stacks of cash sat in an open safe.<br> &nbsp;<br> Thomas nodded curtly,&nbsp;<i>sit,&nbsp;</i>and the men sat. He studied a dossier of unknown contents in silence. Then he made his position clear to Schelkmann: he would not tolerate any splinter resistance groups. Military actions taken outside his command were acts of treason, plain and simple. With seemingly offhand gestures, Thomas belit�tled Schelkmann and his small group, taking frequent phone calls to emphasize his indifference to them. Subordinates came and went with apparently urgent communiqu�s. Flustered, the Nazi major now offered some of the details that Thomas was after: his background, the backgrounds of the other SS men in the room, the name of his network, its charter, methods, and structure, and how its members were recruited.<br> &nbsp;<br> The CIC&#x2019;s operation that night wasn&#x2019;t flawless. Thomas&#x2019;s elabo�rate fiction required roughly thirty people acting in concert, each with assigned scripts. Small mistakes and inconsistencies in the the�atrical performance were inevitable. Counterintelligence operations turn on such minutiae&#x2014;on whether the strange hesitation, bizarre response, or involuntary twitch is interpreted as sinister or benign. That&#x2019;s why a certain Soviet spy, as the anthropologist Margaret Mead once noted, smoked a pipe. It immobilized his facial expres�sions. Buttons whose holes were sewn in a crisscross rather than a parallel pattern could reveal an agent&#x2019;s nationality and destroy an otherwise perfect operation. In Egypt, a foreign agent was once dis�covered because of his giveaway stance at a public urinal. No detail is insignificant to the intelligence operative, as Thomas knew, and Schelkmann&#x2019;s background in intelligence was formidable.<br> &nbsp;<br> Schelkmann had two chances to unmask that night&#x2019;s hoax. His first came when he asked to be appointed Thomas&#x2019;s head of intel�ligence. &#x201c;I had not anticipated this,&#x201d; Thomas later told his biogra�pher, Christopher Robbins. &#x201c;I could hardly grant the man&#x2019;s request without bringing him into the organization, which was obviously impossible. I pointed out the weakness in his operation, which in reality I was forced to admire.&#x201d; Thomas not only had to feign the workings of a fake espionage conspiracy, but also had to disparage a well-managed spy network on cue. Schelkmann didn&#x2019;t catch on and didn&#x2019;t protest. The second make-or-break moment of the night&#x2014;the most dangerous one, according to Thomas&#x2014;was when Schelkmann unexpectedly asked for orders.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Und was befehlen Sie uns jetzt zu tun?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>And what would you command us to do now?&nbsp;</i>Thomas feared, as Rob�bins recounted it, that &#x201c;his mask had momentarily slipped and that he had stepped out of character.&#x201d; Yet again, the SS men didn&#x2019;t notice. Thomas recovered, ordering the Germans to hold off on any pend�ing operations and to prepare for an inspection. His performance was vulnerable twice. But Schelkmann had missed it both times.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Here was the payoff of the gauntlet of blindfolds, switched vehicles, muddy marching, rain-soaked clothing, and humiliating treatment that the conspirators had been forced to endure: clues ignored, tells overlooked. The success of that night&#x2019;s scheme didn&#x2019;t depend on its perfect execution. On the contrary, Thomas knew there would inevi�tably be slip-ups that might reveal the charade and force him to ar�rest the Nazis immediately. His talent was to manipulate their mood and undermine their sense of control so that they would be less likely to notice such momentary stumbles.<br> &nbsp;<br> Some months later, when Thomas left his work with the CIC in Germany for America, a new agent took over the task of roping in the diehard Nazi underground. Posing as Frundsberg&#x2019;s deputy, this replacement arranged a meeting with Schelkmann and his men at a local beer hall. Wives and girlfriends were allowed. This time, when a tense moment came and the undercover agent seemed flustered, the German conspirators sensed that something was off. They ques�tioned him aggressively. The panicking CIC agent pulled a gun, and the other CIC undercover officers tucked elsewhere at the bar&#x2014;his backup&#x2014;had no choice but to move in and arrest the men, netting far fewer of the group&#x2019;s contacts than they&#x2019;d hoped.<br> &nbsp;<br> Schelkmann himself would serve twelve years in prison. When they were initially charged, he and his men vehemently denied the prosecution&#x2019;s seemingly incomprehensible claim that Frundsberg, too, had been working for the Americans. Just as Thomas&#x2019;s students opened their minds, the SS men had closed theirs.<br> &nbsp;<br> *************<br> &nbsp;<br> THIS BOOK LOOKS at how we make sense of the world. It&#x2019;s about what happens when we&#x2019;re confused and the path forward isn&#x2019;t ob�vious. Of course, most of the challenges of daily life are perfectly straightforward.

The <i>REAL</i> history? It&#x2019;s a story of how regular people banded together and, armed with little more than their brains and good aim defeated a mighty foe.<br><br> Not long ago the streets of New York City were smelly, smoggy, sooty, and loud. There were so many trucks making deliveries that it might take an hour for a car to travel a few blocks. People blamed the truck owners and the truck owners blamed the little wooden pushcarts that traveled the city selling everything from flowers to hot dogs. Behind closed doors the truck owners declared war on the pushcart peddlers. Carts were smashed from Chinatown to Chelsea. The peddlers didn&#x2019;t have money or the mayor on their side, but that didn&#x2019;t stop them from fighting back. They used pea shooters to blow tacks into&nbsp;the tires of trucks, they outwitted the police, and they marched right up to the grilles of those giant trucks and dared them to drive down their streets. Today, thanks to the ingenuity of the pushcart peddlers, the streets belong to the people&#x2014;and to the pushcarts.<br><br> <i>The Pushcart War</i> was first published fifty years ago. It has inspired generations of children and been adapted for television, radio, and the stage around the world. It was included on <i>School Library Journal</i>&#x2019;s list of &#x201c;One Hundred Books That Shaped the Twentieth Century,&#x201d; and its assertion that a committed group of men and women can prevail against a powerful force is as relevant in the twenty-first century as it was in 1964.</p><p>The pushcarts have declared war! New York City's streets are clogged with huge, rude trucks that park where they want, hold up traffic, and bulldoze into anything that is in their way, and the pushcart peddlers are determined to get rid of them. But the trucks are just as determined to get rid of the pushcarts, and chaos results in the city.<p></p><p>The pushcarts have come up with a brilliant strategy that will surely let the hot air out of their enemies. The secret weapon--a peashooter armed with a pin; the target--the vulnerable truck tires. Once the source of the flat tires is discovered, the children of the city joyfully join in with their own pin peashooters. The pushcarts have won one battle, but can they win the war against a corrupt mayor who taxes the pins and prohibits the sale of dried peas?</p><b>Jean Merrill </b>(1923&#x2013;2012) was born in Rochester, New York, and grew up on a dairy and apple farm near Lake Ontario.

Saxton's thesis--that white racism was strategic to do you mean `in the interest'? `a concern'?aa both the ruling and working classes and was reinforced by the media and literature--is supported by his analysis of Jacksonian democracy, which promoted the removal of Indians from Western lands and the continuance of slavery as a means of achieving equality among whites. Although white racism served the interests of cut to tighten long sentence. aa/ landowners and industrialists, Saxton shows howok?aa/ok/pk lower-class Americans also benefited economically, and used racism to cross the chasm that separated them from or, for clarity: `ally themselves with'? aa/stet what we have/pk the upper class.

A pretty stenographer you&#x2019;ve seen before comes into the room and you watch her. . . . She takes off her gloves, opens her purse and dumps it out on the table. . . . She has two dimes and a nickel&#x2014;and a cardboard match box. She leaves the nickel on the desk, puts the two dimes back into her purse and takes her black gloves to the stove. . . . Just then your telephone rings. The girl picks it up, says hello&#x2014;listens&#x2014;and says deliberately into the phone, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never owned a pair of black gloves in my life.&#x201d; She hangs up . . . and you glance around very suddenly and see another man in the office, watching every move the girl makes. . . .&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Go on,&#x201d; said Boxley smiling. &#x201c;What happens?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; said Stahr. &#x201c;I was just making pictures.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x2014;The Last Tycoon<br><br> F. Scott Fitzgerald<br><br> In the summer of 1937, F. Scott Fitzgerald, drinking far too much, deeply in debt, and drowning in the suffocating well of despair, moved to Hollywood seeking new beginnings, hoping to reinvent himself by writing for the movies. The author of The Great Gatsby, Tender Is the Night, This Side of Paradise, and the uncompleted The Last Tycoon, perhaps America&#x2019;s greatest novelist, was, as one friend put it, seeking redemption.<br><br> During the two and a half years he spent in Hollywood, he took the craft of screenwriting &#x201c;very seriously,&#x201d; says one noted Fitzgerald authority: &#x201c;It&#x2019;s heartbreaking to see how much effort he put into it.&#x201d; Fitzgerald approached every screenplay as if it were a novel and often wrote long backstories for each of the main characters before putting one word of dialogue down on paper.<br><br> Despite all the preparation he put into each assignment, he was obsessed with finding the answer to a question that haunted him continuously: What makes a good screenplay? Billy Wilder once compared Fitzgerald to &#x201c;a great sculptor who is hired to do a plumbing job. He did not know how to connect the pipes so the water could flow.&#x201d;<br><br> Throughout his Hollywood years, he was always trying to find the &#x201c;balance&#x201d; between the words spoken and the pictures seen. During this time, he received only one screen credit, adapting the novel Three Comrades by Erich Maria Remarque (starring Robert Taylor and Margaret Sullavan), but Joseph L. Mankiewicz eventually rewrote his script. He worked on rewrites for several other movies, including a disastrous week on Gone With the Wind (he was forbidden to use any words that did not appear in Margaret Mitchell&#x2019;s novel), but after Three Comrades, all of his projects ended in fail- ure. One, a script for Joan Crawford called Infidelity, was left uncompleted, canceled because it dealt with the theme of adultery. Fitzgerald died in 1941, working on his last, unfinished novel, The Last Tycoon.<br><br> He died believing himself to be a failure.<br><br> I&#x2019;ve always been intrigued by the journey of F. Scott Fitzgerald. What resonates with me the most is that he was constantly searching for the answer to what made a good screenplay. His overwhelming external circumstances&#x2014;his wife Zelda&#x2019;s institutionalization, his unmanageable debts and lifestyle, his excessive drinking&#x2014;all fed into his insecurities about the craft of screenwriting. And make no mistake: Screenwriting is a craft, a craft that can be learned. Even though he worked excessively hard, and was disciplined and responsible, he failed to achieve the results he was so desperately striving for.<br><br> Why?<br><br> I don&#x2019;t think there&#x2019;s any one answer. But reading his books and writings and letters from this period, it seems clear that he was never exactly sure what a screenplay was; he always wondered whether he was &#x201c;doing it right,&#x201d; whether there were certain rules he had to follow in order to write a successful screenplay.<br><br> When I was studying at the University of California, Berkeley, as an English lit major, I read the first and second editions of Tender Is the Night for one of my classes. It is the story of a psychiatrist who marries one of his patients, who, as she slowly recovers, exhausts his vitality until he is &#x201c;a man used up.&#x201d; The book, the last one Fitzgerald completed, was considered technically faulty and was commercially unsuccessful.<br><br> In the first edition of the novel, Book I is written from the point of view of Rosemary Hoyt, a young actress who shares her obser- vations about meeting the circle that surrounds Dick and Nicole Diver. Rosemary is on the beach at Cap d&#x2019;Antibes on the French Riviera, watching the Divers enjoying an outing on the sand. As she watches, she sees them as a beautiful couple who appear, at least from her point of view, to have everything going for them. They are, she thinks, the ideal couple. Rich, beautiful, intelligent, they look to be the embodiment of what everyone wants for himself or herself. But the second book of the novel focuses on the life of Dick and Nicole, and we learn that what we saw through Rosemary&#x2019;s eyes was only the relationship they showed to the world; it was not really true. The Divers have major problems, which drain them emotionally and spiritually, and ultimately destroy them.<br><br> When the first edition of Tender Is the Night was published, sales were poor, and Fitzgerald thought he had probably been drinking too much and might have compromised his vision. But from his Hollywood experience, he came to believe he did not introduce his main characters early enough. &#x201c;Its great fault,&#x201d; Fitzgerald wrote of Tender Is the Night to his editor, Maxwell Perkins, &#x201c;is that the true beginning&#x2014;the young psychiatrist in Switzerland&#x2014;is tucked away in the middle of the book.&#x201d; He decided that when the second edition was printed, he would interchange the first section with the second and open the novel with Dick Diver in wartime Switzerland in order to explain the mystery about the Divers&#x2019; courtship and marriage. So he opened the book focusing on the main character, Dick Diver. But that didn&#x2019;t work either, and Fitzgerald was crushed. The book was financially unsuccessful until many years later, when Fitzgerald&#x2019;s genius was finally acknowledged.<br><br> What strikes me so vividly is what Fitzgerald didn&#x2019;t see; his opening section focusing on how Rosemary saw the Divers was more cinematic than novelistic. It&#x2019;s a great cinematic opening, setting up the characters as others see them, like an establishing shot; in this first edition, Fitzgerald was showing us how this model couple looked to the world, beautiful and rich, seeming to have everything. How we look to the outside world, of course, is a lot different from who we really are behind closed doors. My personal feeling is that it was Fitzgerald&#x2019;s insecurity about the craft of screenwriting that drove him to change that great opening.<br><br> F. Scott Fitzgerald was an artist literally caught between two worlds, caught between his genius as a writer and his self-doubt and inability to express that genius in screenplay form.<br><br> Screenwriting is a definite craft, a definite art. Over the years, I&#x2019;ve read thousands upon thousands of screenplays, and I always look for certain things. First, how does it look on the page? Is there plenty of white space, or are the paragraphs dense, too thick, the dialogue too long? Or is the reverse true: Is the scene description too thin, the dialogue too sparse? And this is before I read one word; this is just what it &#x201c;looks&#x201d; like on the page. You&#x2019;d be surprised how many decisions are made in Hollywood by the way a screenplay looks&#x2014;you can tell whether it&#x2019;s been written by a professional or by someone who&#x2019;s still aspiring to be a professional.<br><br> Everybody is writing screenplays, from the waiter at your favorite bar or restaurant to the limo driver, the doctor, the lawyer, or the barista serving up the White Chocolate Dream Latte at the local Coffee Bean. Last year, more than seventy-five thousand screenplays were registered at the Writers Guild of America, West and East, and out of that number maybe four or five hundred scripts were actually produced.<br><br> What makes one screenplay better than another? There are many answers, of course, because each screenplay is unique. But if you want to sit down and spend six months to a year writing a screenplay, you first have to know what a screenplay is&#x2014;what its nature is.<br><br> What is a screenplay? Is it a guide, or an outline, for a movie? A blueprint, or a diagram? Or maybe it&#x2019;s a series of images, scenes, and sequences strung together with dialogue and description, like pearls on a strand? Perhaps it&#x2019;s simply the landscape of a dream?<br><br> Well, for one thing, a screenplay is not a novel, and it&#x2019;s most certainly not a play. If you look at a novel and try to define its fundamental nature, you&#x2019;ll see that the dramatic action, the story line, usually takes place inside the head of the main character. We see the story line unfold through the eyes of the character, through his/her point of view. We are privy to the character&#x2019;s thoughts, feelings, emotions, words, actions, memories, dreams, hopes, ambitions, opinions, and more. The character and reader go through the action together, sharing in the drama and emotion of the story. We know how they act, feel, react, and figure things out. If other characters appear and are brought into the narrative line of action, then the story embraces their point of view, but the main thrust of the story line always returns to the main character. The main character is who the story is about. In a novel the action takes pla...</p><h2>Sisters Brothers</h2><p>Modern Paperback.

And throughout his sentence, the young Senator tracked the greatest crime of all: the deliberate waste of untapped human potential. </p><p> Smith saw the power of millions of inmates harnessed as a source of renewable energy for America&#x2019;s prison-industrial complex, a system that aims to build better criminals instead of better citizens. In <i>Mr. Smith Goes to Prison</i>, he traces the cracks in America&#x2019;s prison walls, exposing the shortcomings of a racially-based cycle of poverty and crime that sets inmates up to fail. Speaking from inside experience, he offers practical solutions to jailbreak the nation from the financially crushing grip of its own prisons and to jumpstart the rehabilitation of the millions living behind bars.</p></p><p><b>Jeff Smith </b>is a former Missouri State Senator who represented the city of St. Louis from 2007 until 2009, when he pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice in a previous campaign.

This novel offers an account of that long summer when only a handful of fighter planes could prevent a British defeat.</p><p>Ralph Hammond Innes was born in Horsham, Sussex, on 15 July 1913 and educated at Cranbrook School, Kent. He left school aged eighteen, and worked successively in publishing, teaching and journalism. In 1936, in need of money in order to marry, he wrote a supernatural thriller, The Doppleganger, which was published in 1937 as part of a two-year, four book deal. In 1939 Innes moved to a different publisher, and began to write compulsively, continuing to publish throughout his service in the Royal Artillery during the Second World War. Innes travelled widely to research his novels and always wrote from personal experience - his 1940s novels The Blue Ice and The White South were informed by time spent working on a whaling ship in the Antarctic, while The Lonely Skier came out of a post-war skiing course in the Dolomites. He was a keen and accomplished sailor, which passion inspired his 1956 bestseller The Wreck of the Mary Deare. The equally successful 1959 film adaptation of this novel enabled Innes to buy a large yacht, the Mary Deare, in which he sailed around the world for the next fifteen years, accompanied by his wife and fellow author Dorothy Lang. Innes wrote over thirty novels, as well as several works of non-fiction and travel journalism. His thrilling stories of spies, counterfeiters, black markets and shipwreck earned him both literary acclaim and an international following, and in 1978 he was awarded a CBE. Hammond Innes died at his home in Suffolk on 10th June 1998.</p><h2>MacArthur and Defeat in the Philippines</h2><p>A compelling portrait of the World War II battle for the Philippines traces Douglas MacArthur&#39;s special relationship with the islands. 20,000 first printing.</p><p>If we are to trust military historian Richard Connaughton's account, the Japanese forces that invaded the Philippines shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor were fortunate that they faced Douglas MacArthur and not some competent and cautious general like Joseph Stilwell. MacArthur, writes Connaughton, "was a distant, remote, suspicious, and brooding man whose ego set him apart from others in the services."<p> There's no news in that assessment--MacArthur was infamous long before the Japanese attack for his imperious manner and sense of infallibility, and during the siege of Corregidor he earned the nickname "Dugout Doug" for secluding himself in a bunker far from his troops. What does come as news is in Connaughton's in-depth analysis of MacArthur's multifaceted failings as commander of American forces in the Philippines, which include his refusal to accept intelligence reports on the whereabouts and strength of his enemy, his failure to integrate Filipino forces effectively, and his strategically inept forward defense--all of which afforded an undersize Japanese invading force a comparatively easy victory.</p><p> Connaughton, a retired colonel in the British Army, has no particular stake in defending or disparaging MacArthur, around whom stands a lively literature both pro and con. In fairness, he observes, the American defense of the Philippines was doomed in any event; and, he adds, "MacArthur made monstrous blunders but it was not all his fault; he had a lot of help." His book throws new light on a crucial episode in the history of World War II, and it is likely to excite debate among students of military history. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>Richard Connaughton retired from the British Army with the rank of Colonel. He is the author of numerous books and essays, including <i>The Battle for Manila</i> (1995).</p><h2>EMERGENCE OF POTTERY PB (Smithsonian Series in Archaeological Inquiry)</h2><p>&#34;Includes chapters by A.C.

The miniature figures that people the pages, admiring (and sometimes deploring) nature and their surroundings, are characterful and humorous.

The idea felt right to them--"a shop our late father would've loved just by virtue of its contents: chocolates and daughters"--and despite their inexperience, they decide to go for it, with their mother as silent partner. In 1984, on the day f their Washington, D.C., store, named Chocolate Chocolate, opened, they already were beset with difficulties, from crumbling walls and cracking floors installed by a shoddy, shady contractor to trying to conjure strategies to gain attention and sales. Bit by bit, their clientele grows; the sisters write fondly and often humorously of the recurring characters in their new, chocolate-centric lives, from favorite customers to the kooky sales rep who becomes an employee and dear friend. They easily move between musings on friendship and family, all the while offering inspiration and valuable lessons for budding entrepreneurs. The recipe for their house truffle rounds out this appealing, engaging memoir that's sure to appeal to a range of readers, chocoholics or not.&nbsp;<i>--Publishers Weekly</i></p></p><p>Sisters FRANCES AND GINGER PARK have been nibbling on bonbons and making friends at&nbsp;Chocolate Chocolate&nbsp;since 1984.&nbsp;&nbsp;Award-winning authors, the sisters&nbsp;love to write books for&nbsp;readers of all ages and have been interviewed on National Public Radio, 'Good Morning America', CNN and the Diane Rehm Show.&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently at work&nbsp;on separate novels, they still&nbsp;find time to collaborate.&nbsp; <p></p>Chapter 1<br><br>Baci Kiss<br>&nbsp;<br>Starry foil wraps velvety dark chocolate around a creamy hazelnut nugget and a love note to remember<br>January 11, 1984.<br>&#x201c;Lights on, Ginge.&#x201d;<br>On a bitterly cold day in the nation&#x2019;s capital&#x2014;a day so cold the statues were cracking&#x2014;our moods matched the sky.

After mulling, Francie claimed a royal blue box from the shelves, loosening the white chiffon ribbon and peeling off the seal. The lid lifted up like a cigar box, revealing rows of bonbons dressed up in silver foil with blue stars. Nugget shaped, these were the world-class Perugina confections known as Baci (&#x201c;kiss&#x201d; in Italian). Pure opera.<br>&#x201c;Dig in, Ginge.&#x201d;<br>One Baci for Ginger&#x2014;<i>pluck.</i>&nbsp;One Baci for Francie&#x2014;<i>pluck.</i><br>Even unwrapping our Bacis was an exquisite affair. The love notes tucked inside the foil were almost as comforting as the creamy-crunchy hazelnut chocolate itself&#x2014;we were both promised exciting romance in the near future. Since neither of us had much of a love life going on, the Baci tasted twice as nice. Life just got a&nbsp;<i>little</i>&nbsp;grander.<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>The Reagan era in Washington, D.C., was a time of luxury and excess. Chic boutiques lined the streets and socialite types in minks stepped in and out of limos&#x2014;it was winter, always winter. For two girls grounded in their Korean parents&#x2019; humble beginnings in this country, the dripping wealth came close to culture shock.<br>Still, we&#x2019;d done our homework and asked our architect to design a ritzy-glitzy sweetshop that captured the look of the day with Italian lighting, mirror-finish black marble floors, and three bubble-glassed candy cases. We were lucky enough to seal the deal on this location a stone&#x2019;s throw from the White House on Connecticut Avenue. Now our little no-name shop stood among Burberry and Cartier like Cinderella at the ball, a shop our late father would&#x2019;ve loved just by virtue of its contents: chocolates and daughters. Were he alive, he could walk over from the World Bank during his lunch hour and visit us.<br>Yet were he alive, we would never have gone into business in the first place.<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>A few years earlier, Mom was accompanying Dad on a business trip to Bangkok that first included a personal stop to Seoul. Their itinerary, however, was cut short: En route, Dad suffered a fatal stroke in his sleep on the ninth floor of the Hyatt Regency Waikiki Hotel.<br>Back home, we were stunned. Lost. Dad was the one we looked up to. In a world where we grew up feeling we didn&#x2019;t quite belong, where even some of our neighbors made us feel unwelcome for being Asian, Dad&#x2019;s mere presence made us feel safe.<br>His World Bank colleagues always kidded him for settling his family down in middle-class Springfield instead of Great Falls and for driving a Gran Torino instead of a Mercedes-Benz. But Dad shunned lavish living on a globe where orphans still wandered and begged on the streets of postwar Seoul. He left their haunted faces behind, but sometimes the American way of life was a guilt trip for Dad. The truth was, he&#x2019;d drive a jalopy as long as his family was with him.<br>That last night, had Dad known he would never wake up, he would never have fallen asleep.<br>While our siblings&#x2014;older sister Grace and brother in between us Sam&#x2014;remained close by, we grew Siamese. And while our natures were night and day&#x2014;Francie dark, Ginger bright&#x2014;without Dad, the only way we felt whole was to cling to each other, so cling we did, sister to sister until our souls were stitched tight. If we stuck together, somehow things would work out. Our grief was so deep only the promise to stick together and look after our widowed mother made us able to cope. Feel whole.<br>At the time, Francie, a published poet who couldn&#x2019;t stomach the New York literary scene, was halfheartedly working in an office at George Washington University. She was taking graduate courses in this and that and was dating a sweet pot-smoking professor. Because she didn&#x2019;t want to marry, Jim moved on&#x2014;literally, to teach in Chicago. Ginger, who was attending a local college, had been infatuated with her guitar-strumming boyfriend Matt until she got the sense that he cared more about his guitar than her. Soon enough, she broke things off.<br>Suddenly, we were both single. Our destiny up for grabs.<br>Ginger lived at Mom&#x2019;s house with our moping Irish setter. Every night at seven o&#x2019;clock sharp, Goldie would sit on the staircase by the front door and wait for Dad to come home from work. Francie rented an apartment closer to the city, though she was over half the time.<br>&#x201c;Why not you save money and live here?&#x201d; Mom would beg her. &#x201c;Two empty bedroom.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Sorry, Mom,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d decline with a hug.<br>At twenty-four, Francie needed her own place, somewhere to steal away to if only for a moment and ponder the literary what-ifs of her life, even if her own current catchphrase was &#x201c;It ain&#x2019;t happening now.&#x201d; She had Dad&#x2019;s death to recover from.<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>Chocolate was our comfort food, and we spent our days munching away on Hershey Kisses wondering whether we should go into business together, invest in a new life with the small inheritance Dad left us. Not really a far-fetched idea&nbsp;...<br>Once upon a time, we were Big Sis, Little Sis, celebrating every Christmas next to the fake silver tree our family dragged out of the attic year after year.<br>One particular holiday, the fireplace crackled and spat while Dad nursed his pipe and Mom puffed on her beloved Virginia Slims. Ginger was putting on an acrobatic show for the family, a razzle-dazzle routine of handstands, somersaults, and aerials. Between sips of sherry, our parents watched their youngest and nodded, whispering to each other in Korean. Sitting on the plaid couch in our wood-paneled rec room, sharing the stolen moment, they came together as almost the same person.<br>Christmas in our household had always been about singing Korean songs and eating hot chestnuts, not exchanging extravagant gifts. So Ginger couldn&#x2019;t believe her eyes when she tore the wrapping off a big red-and-gold-striped box and found that her wildest dream had come true: At six years old, she was the proud owner of an Easy-Bake Oven.<br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe it!&#x201d; She danced around the room.<br>&#x201c;Sorry, Ginge, but you&#x2019;re too little to operate this thing by yourself,&#x201d; Francie observed.<br>Mom set up the oven on the yellow laminate kitchen counter to the right of the sink. There, facing a window that overlooked our backyard, we spent every morning of that Christmas vacation baking up a storm. The Easy-Bake Oven Shoppe was open for business! By noon, the whole house smelled of cake. When Dad came home from work, the lingering aroma, warm and homey, put him in a good mood.<br>&#x201c;My little bakers have been busy!&#x201d;<br>We were a true sister act, bickering, laughing, and licking our fingers, our entire focus that holiday on an oven whose heat source was a thumb-sized lightbulb. We burned through bulb after bulb, making miniature cakes from Easy-Bake kit mixes, turning them out so fast we could&#x2019;ve opened up shop. The cake mixes came in several varieties, but one flavor ruled.<br>Chocolate.<br>When we ran out of the chocolate mixes, we had to think, think, think. How could we turn the white cakes into chocolate ones?<br>Francie clapped. &#x201c;I got it.&#x201d;<br>We mixed a spoonful or two of cocoa into the white cake mix until the powder turned chocolate colored. Then we added water and stirred the brown batter into the two mini&#x2013;cake pans. Breathless, we slid the pans into the Easy-Bake and peered through the glass window waiting for the moment the cakes began to puff higher and higher.<br>&#x201c;Here it comes, Ginge.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Wow...&#x201d;<br>When the cakes were cooled, Ginger proved her wunderkind ways when it came to things chocolate.<br>&#x201c;Get me down the Bosco!&#x201d;<br>Grinning wickedly, she spooned the syrup all over the cooled cake. The frosting, though runny, was gorgeously chocolate, as was every black crumb on the counter.<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>So, could we stay Big Sis, Little Sis as business partners? Did we have the true enterprising spirit to make it work?<br>Dreams&nbsp;<i>were</i>&nbsp;possible. Our parents, who had survived harsh times in Korea under Japanese rule and the Korean War, were proof. Dad, reared in a one-room mud hut with a family of eight, was blessed with a passport out of poverty: a gift for language. He worked his way to Harvard University and the World Bank until one day he bought the house of his dreams in suburban Virginia where he planted his gardens and built a life. Meanwhile, Mom, with an English all her own, staked her claim as boss of the Park home and, despite a childhood of being served meals by maids, learned to cook Korean feasts the neighbors could only dream of. That our parents came to America with nothing more than the clothes on their backs made us believe we too could do anything we set our minds to.<br>Since we were chocoholics long before it was a diagnosis, opening a sweet boutique felt like the most natural thing in the world. We began to dream of a store filled to the brim with chocolate, the smell of it wafting onto the street and luring in strangers. Maybe we&#x2019;d even make friends. Build a business and a life, a rich life, around chocolate. Our shop would be our home away from home.<br>The only problem? We were two blind mice who didn&#x2019;t know what we were doing. After all, how on earth do you build a mythical chocolate castle? We couldn&#x2019;t even come up with a name.<br>Chocolate Heaven? No.<br>The Chocolate Bar? No, no.<br>A Chocolate Affair? No, no, no.<br>Aside from Mom, who planned to be our silent partner, most people thought we were out of our minds to go into business, especially when interest rates for bank certificates of deposit ranged from eighteen to twenty-one percent. You girls will&nbsp;<i>never</i>&nbsp;see that kind of return. How much chocolate can you&nbsp;<i>really</i>&nbsp;sell? Plus, you have no experience. Play it safe. Keep doing what you&#x2019;re doing.<br>We didn&#x2019;t listen. We had our calling.<br>Besides, we were sure we had Dad&#x2019;s blessing. In his lifetime, he fulfilled many dreams but not the Big One: to one day return to his war-torn homeland and help make a difference; perhaps even run for president. As a senior at Yonsei University, Dad had been appointed personal secretary to the country&#x2019;s first president-elect, Syngman Rhee; fluent in English, his role was to serve as a liaison between Korea and the United States. The Korean War would change everyone&#x2019;s fate, including his. During his years at Harvard grad school, the political climate in Korea turned more dangerous than ever, and he ended up not only postponing the dream but also resculpting his ambitions in America. He took much pleasure and contentment in life here. However, in 1979, the timing turned ripe, both politically and personally. Ginger was ready to graduate from high school and he was offered a cabinet position in Korea. Now he was ready to fly to Seoul to engage in discussions and hopefully live out his dream. Tragically, it was on that trip that he lost his life.<br>Yes, we had Dad&#x2019;s blessing every step of the way. And it wouldn&#x2019;t surprise him to know we were still thinking chocolate.<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>One day Ginger pulled a batch of brownies out of the oven to cool while Francie sat at the kitchen table at Mom&#x2019;s house&#x2014;our designated &#x201c;headquarters&#x201d;&#x2014;perusing wholesale catalogs mailed to us from San Francisco&#x2019;s Ghirardelli Chocolates and the Dutch maker Droste. We were trying to drum up a name for our shop to be. Think, damn it, think&nbsp;... The brownie aroma was too distracting.<br>Ginger sliced her sister a brownie nearly as big as the paper napkin it was served on. Francie&#x2019;s first bite was accompanied by an uninhibited groan of pleasure.<br>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;d you find this recipe? They&#x2019;re so chocolaty.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No recipe.&#x201d; Ginger chewed. &#x201c;I just added chocolate chips so they&#x2019;re twice as chocolaty. Double chocolate.&#x201d;<br>Francie licked crumbs, eyes dreamy, half closed. &#x201c;Chocolate&nbsp;... chocolate...&#x201d;<br>Ginger looked at her. &#x201c;What&#x2019;d you say?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I said&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>At that sister-to-sister moment, genius struck us.<br>&#x201c;CHOCOLATE CHOCOLATE!&#x201d;<br>We high-fived.<br>We hugged.<br>We did a silly dance.<br>Ginger sliced the rest of her brownies into mouth-popping bite-sized cubes. We popped away, starved.<br>&#x201c;You know, you should think about making a signature piece of chocolate,&#x201d; Francie suggested. &#x201c;Just one piece to put us on the map.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Naw, too much pressure.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d help.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re a ditz in the kitchen.&#x201d; Ginger coughed up crumbs. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t even sift flour.&#x201d;<br>Licking her fingers, Francie laughed. &#x201c;True, so true.&#x201d;<br>Soon thereafter, we both quit doing what we were doing. No longer lost, we would road-map our lives together, with Mom at our side, of course. Dad, too, in spirit.<br><br>&nbsp;<br>Copyright � 2011 by Frances Park and Ginger Park</p><h2>The Best of The Smiths</h2><p>Features a dozen melancholy masterpieces from Morrissey and Johnny Marr: The Boy with the Thorn in His Side * Girlfriend in a Coma * Hand in Glove * The Hand That Rocks the Cradle * Heaven Knows I&#39;m Miserable Now * How Soon Is Now * Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me * Please, Please, Please, Let Me Get What I Want * There Is a Light That Never Goes Out * This Charming Man * What Difference Does It Make?</p><p></p><h2>Joshua: A Brooklyn Tale</h2><p>Against a backdrop of racial tensions and spanning four decades, <i>JOSHUA: A Brooklyn Tale </i>explores the entanglements of three lives: Joshua Eubanks, a young black man struggling to overcome the crime, drugs, and despair of the streets; Rachel Weissman, daughter of a Hassidic rabbi, wrestling pangs of rebelliousness against the insular and restrictive practices of her religion; and Paul Sims, the product of a privileged Long Island Jewish family, yearning to escape his troubled past. Joshua first encounters Rachel in the local synagogue, where he works as an assistant to the custodian. Over the years their bond intensifies, though their lives diverge. Rachel aspires to be a doctor, a blasphemous choice for a woman in her culture.&nbsp; Joshua kills a man in self defense, and is alienated from his own community. Paul leaves his home to find solace in the Hasidic enclave of Crown Heights. From different worlds and unaware they share a father, Joshua and Paul see their lives collide in a quest for Rachel's love. Through these and other challenges, culminating with the 1991 Crown Heights riots, Joshua explores the tensions between two communities in close physical proximity, but still worlds apart. Through Joshua, Rachel, and Paul, a vision of hope is offered, but is tempered by the reality of human frailty and tragedy.</p><p>Andrew Kane is the author of the critically acclaimed, controversial novel <i>Rabbi, Rabbi.</i> He holds a PhD in psychology from Yeshiva University and is a clinical psychologist in private practice.

Here too are countless practical hints on every aspect of gardening, as well as complete essays on individual flowers and plants: philodendrons, clivias, Easter lilies, heaths and heathers, tulips, orchid cacti, winter-blooming geraniums and regal geraniums, tuberous begonias, gloxinias, amaryllis and other South African bulbs. And the results of her unending quest for new ideas and zestful experimentation: how to transfer water-rooted cuttings to soil, the best ways to grow paper whites, the effect of different lighting and watering patterns on various types of ivy, ways of growing biennials in the New England climate, and how to raise corn, squash , and beans Indian style. There are also helpful suggestion on finding and raising your own unusual varieties of chrysanthemums for indoor use, on the cutting back and control of grape vines, on tomato culture that even young children can master and enjoy, on the care and treatment of lower beds in the fall, on the winter marking of branches and bushes for later selective pruning. To Everything There Is a Season is alive with Thalassa Cruso&#39;s keen sensitivity to the natural world. She evokes the tension and expectancy of a garden waiting for the onslaught of winter snow, reminisces about the gardens of her English childhood and the joy of delving into old gardening books, records the wonders of the New England countryside (its wildflowers and wildlife, its flamboyant fall color, its salt marshes and roadside gardens), and writes provocatively of the balance of nature and the need for conservation - both public and private. Like Thalassa herself, her new book is wise, witty, worm, and human.</p><p></p><h2>For Love of the Game</h2><p>Billy Chapel, a major league pitcher headed for the Hall of Fame, allows his loyalty to the game, his enduring youth, and his pure spirit to threaten his career</p><p>Serious sports novels often fall through the literary cracks simply because of the arena they play in. Michael Shaara earned his battle stripes--and a Pulitzer Prize--for <i>The Killer Angels</i>, a fictional resurrection of the Battle of Gettysburg, as serious a subject as a writer can confront. Yet, it's no more profound, in the end, than the personal dilemmas protagonist Billy Chapel faces in this, Shaara's final novel, found stashed in a desk after his death and published posthumously.<p> A certain Hall of Famer, Chapel is a major-league anomaly, a contemporary throwback to another sporting era. He's pitched 17 stellar seasons for the same club, and his love of the game has remained paramount; neither money nor fame has been his motivation. But on the single day this story takes place, he finds himself in crisis. At the crossroads of his life, his career, and his future, he must make the hard choices that will define the direction of the rest of his life. It's the end of the season, his team's out of contention, there's a rumor he may have been traded, and the woman he can't fully acknowledge that he loves announces she's leaving him. It is, as he tells himself, "Time to grow up, Daydreamer." Still, he dreams, but he also acts. As Billy takes the mound for his final start of the year--and maybe forever--we enter his stream of consciousness, and rush with him over the sometimes treacherous rapids of what has preceded this moment, and what may come. Amazingly, though his mind seems to wander through time, his concentration is fierce. Pitch by pitch, inning by inning, he remains focused, honoring his job and his legacy as he pitches a masterpiece of mythic proportion, ultimately leaving the field more a man than when he took it. Using baseball to sound the depths of human experience, Shaara delivers a masterpiece, as well. <i>--Jeff Silverman</i></p><br>"Moving, beautiful . . .

By the author of American Fool. 50,000 first printing.</p><p>Martin Torgoff came of age just about the same time as the drug boom, a circumstance that informs his overview of America's "Great Stoned Age." Chronicling the irrepressible onslaught of mind-altering substances from the end of World War II through the close of the century, Torgoff (whose previous publishing efforts have centered around rockers Elvis Presley and John Cougar Mellencamp) intersperses the personal with the historical. Laying the groundwork with his own recollections of indulgence beginning in the late 1960s, the author flashes back to the Beat era, which he asserts opened the door for all that followed. Interviews with the obscure and celebrated add color and detail to the chronicle. Here's Herbert Huncke, the unapologetic hustler and heroin addict who lurked on the periphery of '50s bohemian scene and turned up as a character in William Burroughs' pulp memoir <i>Junkie</i>. Into the 1960s, there's acid guru Timothy Leary, poet Allan Ginsburg, record producer Paul Rothchild, Woodstock MC Wavy Gravy, and others caught up in a wave of revolutionary experimentation and excess. The '70s leads to the cocaine craze (embodied here by party girl Suzie Ryan), which begets drug wars (with plenty of casualties on both sides), Just Say No, the crack epidemic, and rave culture. While Torgoff's tome is too capricious to serve as the final word on America's drug obsession, it's eminently readable and entertaining, thanks to its expansive, pop-culture-informed tone. There's an almost insane momentum to this tale, with dozens of astonishing twists and turns. Imagine Jimmy Carter's drug czar, Dr. Peter Bourne, snorting cocaine at a party thrown the by pot legalization group NORML. Then picture George H.W. Bush's point man on drugs, William Bennett, remarking in an interview that it would be "morally plausible" to behead drug dealers. So much for moderation. <i>--Steven Stolder</i><b>Martin Torgoff</b> has been a contributing editor at <i>Interview</i> and a producer for CNN "World Beat."

He has hobnobbed with the glamorous and powerful, counting Elizabeth Taylor, Jane Seymour, and Cary Grant among his contemporaries and friends. He has outrageous stories about foulmouthed Milton Berle, surly Richard Burton, and kindhearted Richard Kiel, infamous as Bond enemy Jaws.

This volume collects twelve essays by leading Civil War scholars who demonstrate how the meanings of the Civil War have changed over time. <br><br>The essays move among a variety of cultural and political arenas--from public monuments to parades to political campaigns; from soldiers' memoirs to textbook publishing to children's literature--in order to reveal important changes in how the memory of the Civil War has been employed in American life. Setting the politics of Civil War memory within a wide social and cultural landscape, this volume recovers not only the meanings of the war in various eras, but also the specific processes by which those meanings have been created. By recounting the battles over the memory of the war during the last 140 years, the contributors offer important insights about our identities as individuals and as a nation.<br>Contributors:<br>David W.

Yeide, is the first study devoted to Goering s entire paintings collection, providing the only opportunity to look at the collection as a whole and evaluate its place within art collecting and the history of Nazi looting. This carefully documented catalogue, painstakingly assembled from archival documents identified as primary to the Goering collection, is critical to the clarification of provenances of the objects and brings to light information about paintings whose histories and whereabouts have been hidden for decades. </p><p> A culmination of seven years of research by Ms. Yeide, an internationally recognized expert in World War II-era provenance research and co-author of <i>The AAM Guide to Provenance Research</i> which helped define provenance research standards in the United States, this volume is a must for collectors, art dealers, auction houses, researchers, curators, art historians and other scholars. Includes an introduction by Robert M. Edsel, author of The Monuments Men.</p></p><p>The head of the Department of Curatorial Records at The National Gallery of Art since 1990, Nancy Yeide has been involved in World War II-era provenance for the last decade. As an internationally recognized expert on the history of art collecting in the 19th and 20th centuries, she has taken a leading role in conducting provenance research on works in the Gallery s collection and has spoken and written widely on the subject. In 2001, she co-authored the American Association of Museum s Guide to Provenance Research, helping to set and define national standards of provenance research. Ms. Yeide was awarded the prestigious Ailsa Mellon Bruce Sabbatical Curatorial Fellow for 2002-2003, during which time she began the research on the art collection of Reichsmarschall Hermann for her catalogue raisonn� Beyond the Dreams of Avarice: The Hermann Goering Collection. Ms. Yeide s work has also appeared in such distinguished publications such as Apollo, Archives of American Art Journal and Museum News. She holds a Master of Arts from American University and serves on a number of professional advisory panels as well as frequently lecturing on a variety of topics and universities and museums around the world Ms. Yeide and her husband Harry, a foreign affairs analyst and author of World War II military history, live in Maryland.With the Red Army and the Allies closing in on Berlin at the end of World War II, Hermann Goering, second only to Adolf Hitler in the Nazi regime, loaded thousands of paintings on private trains headed for the alpine isolation of Berchtesgaden on the Austrian border in a futile attempt to hide his looted treasures. It didn't take long for the U.S. Army to track down both Goering and his art, numbering some 2,000 paintings. The Reichsmarschall was captured in the Austrian town of Zell am See, and his collection was inventoried and shipped to Munich. The art world is still trying to recover. Out this month, the book marks the first time anyone has attempted to gather everything that's known about Goering's art collection in one place. The book includes 1,500 images of the paintings Goering confiscated or bargained for from compliant art dealers. Goering made some 19 or 20 trips to Paris during the war. Hitler is only known to have visited once, after his armies conquered the city. In addition to establishing that Goering had at least 700 more paintings than previously believed in his collection it had been pegged at about 1,300 Yeide also learned that he frequently traded modern masterpieces for much less illustrious works from the Dutch and German schools of Old Masters. For example, he swapped a Matisse for a painting by a minor 17th-century Dutch painter named Jan van Neck. And he traded away van Gogh's Portrait of Dr. Gachet, which has since gone missing, and Degas's Madame Camus, which is on display in Zurich. - New Haven Advocate, April 14, 2009 --New Haven Advocate, April 14, 2009<br><br>As Hitler's right-hand man, Hermann Goering committed some of the most horrific crimes in history. Yet he surrounded himself with beauty, exploiting his power to loot some of the world's most fantastic works of art and using them to to adorn the walls of Carinhall, his country retreat near Berlin. Now, for the first time, all the paintings have been documented, after a seven-year research project. Photographs of every painting ever possessed by Goering will be published in April in a book that is expected to become an essential research tool for the world's museums. As well as shedding light on Goering as a historical figure, scholars hope the archive will help in the ongoing battle to return looted art to its rightful owners and their descendants. The project, by Nancy Yeide, head of curatorial records at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, has already found that Goering amassed around 2,000 looted works of art at least 700 more than had been previously thought. Ms Yeide scoured wartime archives in the US and Germany, as well as Goering's letters to his dealers and auction catalogues. Goering was essentially a black hole, Ms Yeide commented. No one has ever really looked closely at the collection and tried to reconstruct everything that was ever in it. That has been my goal. When the Allies closed in on Germany at the end of the Second World War, Goering, who had enriched himself during the Nazi regime by diverting government contracts to his own companies, loaded his art collection into a fleet of private trains and moved it deep into Bavaria, and then to the Austrian border. It was too late, however. The trains were intercepted by the Allies, sent to Munich and the contents inventoried. Goering was caught in Bavaria, and committed suicide the day before he was due to be hanged for crimes against humanity following the Nuremberg trials in 1946. Ms Yeide has discovered that the 1945 inventory was far from complete. In the chaotic aftermath of the war, some of the paintings had been left behind and other works had been swapped or bargained away for other more valuable or less "degenerate" paintings. She established that two works stolen by Goering Matisse's Still Life with Sleeping Woman and Pianist and Checker Players were traded for Reclining Nude with Cupid by a minor 17th-century Dutch painter called Jan Van Neck. "There were a disproportionate number of nudes in Goering's collection," she added. Both Matisse works, originally looted from the Paris dealer Paul Rosenberg, are now owned legitimately by the National Gallery of Art in Washington. Other works Goering traded away were, famously, Van Gogh's Portrait of Dr Gachet, which has disappeared since it was auctioned in Tokyo in 1990 for a then record $82.5m, and Degas's Madame Camus, now legitimately in a Zurich art foundation. The book's publisher, Robert Edsel, an author himself and expert in looted artworks, said the book would be of interest to historians and ordinary readers as well as to art experts. There have been lots of books about Goering, but this is the first time as far as we know that someone has done this. It will help historians understand whether Goering was a Renaissance man, as he liked to aggrandise himself, a great collector, or whether he was a buffoon. Nancy has been digging and digging, he added. There are still families looking for stolen art. It is a very timely book. When works surface which they will do this book will be an invaluable tool.

Part travelogue and part historical recreation of the legendary journey of the barbaric Mongol warrior Genghis Khan, Severin employs his trademark wit and insight to offer a rare glimpse of a region seldom seen by Westerners and attempts to retrace the great Khan&#39;s westward sweep of conquest.</p><p>Explorer and author <b>Tim Severin</b> is the author of numerous books including <i> In Search of Robinson Crusoe</i> (ISBN: 046507698X), <i>The Brendan Voyage</i> (ISBN: 0375755241), and <i>In Search of Moby Dick</i> (ISBN : 030681045X). A regular contributor to <i>National Geographic</i>, he lives in County Cork, Ireland.Reflecting that peculiarly British enthusiasm for travel and adventure in distant and usually inclement climes, veteran writer and traveler Severin (Tracking Marco Polo, 1986, etc.) went to Mongolia ``to see how much of the traditional way of life survived.'' Having written a thesis at Oxford on the first Europeans to venture into Central Asia during the great Mongol Empires of the 13th and 14th centuries, Severin was delighted when asked in the late 1980's to visit Mongolia. Once closed to Westerners, the country was now, with the collapse of Communism, welcoming Occidental visitors. The authorities were particularly interested in Severin participating in a projected, but subsequently deferred, epic ride on Mongolian horses to mark the 800th birthday of Genghis Khan. This ride would replicate journeys that Mongolian couriers regularly made in the Middle Ages from Mongolia to France. On his two visits to Mongolia, Severin visited the remote birthplace of Genghis Khan; traveled with Mongolian nomads on horseback over part of the conqueror's route through the mountainous regions of this large but thinly populated country, where summer is brief and winter brutal; encountered a plague-ridden marmot in a region where bubonic plague is endemic, confirming his belief that the Mongols were responsible for introducing the devastating disease to Europe; and met an ancient shaman whose existence testified to the continuing legacy of Genghis Khan. Ultimately, Severin concluded that, despite nearly 70 years of Communist rule, much of the old ways still remain. Rich in information and insight: a vivid portrait of a little- known people who, once the scourge of Europe, rode--on the remarkable horses whose descendants they still ride today--in pursuit of empire as far as the outer gates of Vienna.

The loss of so many structures makes it a particularly poignant record.<br> <br> The book is divided into two parts, the first dealing with the origin and nature of a synagogue. Chapters compare the synagogue to the Temple of Jerusalem and to churches and mosques, discuss the affect of liturgical furnishings on the building's form, and take up such questions as whether there is a Jewish style in architecture, the importance of the designer's religion, the limits that outside society imposed on Jewish building, and the public and private images presented by the minority in its religious architecture.<br> <br> The book's second part analyzes specific buildings with examples ranging in time from the Roman empire to the present. They are taken from almost every European capital from London to Leningrad, and include buildings designed by such distinguished architects as Gottfried Semper and Hector Guimard. Smaller cities' synagogues are also included - medieval Spanish buildings in Toledo; imposing Renaissance examples in Venice and Pinsk; a nineteenth-century skyscraper in Turin; Sir Moses Montefiore's own synagogue; a synagogue that looks like a Gothic church; and the most beautiful of the Polish wooden synagogues. The illustrations of surviving and demolished buildings include old prints and photographs, plans, and paintings, some published here for the first time.

In the late 1940s, Konitz began his career with the Claude Thornhill band, during which time he came into contact with Miles Davis, with whom he would later work on the legendary <i>Birth of the Cool</i> sessions. Konitz is perhaps best known through his association with Lennie Tristano, under whose influence much of his sound evolved, and for his work with Stan Kenton and Warne Marsh. His recordings have ranged from cool bop to experimental improvisation and have appeared on such labels as Prestige, Atlantic, Verve, and Polydor.</p> <p> </p> <p>Crafted out of numerous interviews between the author and his subject, the book offers a unique look at the story of Lee Konitz&#x2019;s life and music, detailing Konitz&#x2019;s own insights into his musical education and his experiences with such figures as Miles Davis, Stan Kenton, Warne Marsh, Lennie Tristano, Charles Mingus, Bud Powell, and Bill Evans.</p> <p>Andy Hamilton is a jazz pianist and contributor to major jazz and contemporary music magazines.

Master Chen, what can we do about it, what can we do?&#x201d; he repeated rather desperately. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;It&#x2019;s been more than a month since we last met, hasn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; I said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Longer than that. Master Chen, you know, a whole month has disappeared! It&#x2019;s terrifying. What should we do about it?&#x201d; Fang said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I tried to change the subject. &#x201c;When did you get back to Beijing?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He didn&#x2019;t answer and then suddenly he sneezed. I handed him my card. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t catch cold. You shouldn&#x2019;t be running around. We can meet later. My phone number and e-mail are on the card.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He put his cap back on and took my card. &#x201c;We can look for it together,&#x201d; he said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I watched him jog off toward the Dongzhi Menwai Embassy Row area, I realized he wasn&#x2019;t just out for a jog, he was on a mission.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><i>Another person not seen in a long time</i><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A couple of days later, I found myself attending the <i>Reading Journal </i>New Year&#x2019;s reception &nbsp;on the second floor of the Sanlian Bookstore on Art Museum East Road. The reception was an annual affair. In the 1990s I used to drop in off and on, but since I moved to Beijing permanently in 2004, I&#x2019;ve come up every other year to shoot the breeze a while with the older writers and editors, just to let the cultural world know that I&#x2019;m still alive. I never bother with the younger ones&#x2014;I don&#x2019;t know them and they don&#x2019;t seem to feel any need to know me.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The atmosphere at the reception was somehow different from previous years; the guests seemed quite elated. For the past year, I&#x2019;ve noticed that I, too, have often felt some sort of unaccountable cheerfulness, but the high spirits that day still took me aback. That day everybody was so euphoric it was as if they&#x2019;d just knocked back a few shots of Jack Daniel&#x2019;s.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The venerable founder of&nbsp;<i>Reading, </i>Zhuang&nbsp;Zizhong, hadn&#x2019;t made&nbsp;an appearance at&nbsp;a reception for a while, but &nbsp;this time he turned up in his wheelchair. There was quite a crowd jostling around him, so I didn&#x2019;t go over to say hello. Besides Old Zhuang, all the staff at the journal&#x2014;those who were still alive, that is&#x2014;had all showed up. That was no minor miracle. In all the years I&#x2019;ve been associated with the Sanlian and its journal, <i>Reading, </i>I&#x2019;ve never seen such a grand occasion.&nbsp;It left me pleasantly surprised. I&#x2019;m quite cynical about human nature. I&#x2019;ve never believed that the inner workings of any organization were completely harmonious, especially not any mainland-Chinese organization, and particularly not state-operated enterprises, including state-operated cultural units.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That day all the writers and editors whom I knew greeted me with excessive enthusiasm; but when I started to strike up a proper conversation, their attention had already shifted and they hurried off to someone else. This sort of treatment is pretty common at receptions and cocktail parties, especially when you&#x2019;re not a star. After being greeted and then snubbed two or three times, I readjusted my attitude and returned to my usual one&#x2014;that of an observer. I have to admit I was pretty moved by what I saw: so many celebrated &nbsp;and diverse members &nbsp;of the &nbsp;intellectual &nbsp;elite gathered &nbsp;together&nbsp;in one place looking genuinely happy, even euphoric . . . This really must be a true age of peace and prosperity, I thought to myself.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was feeling pretty good, but very quickly I got the feeling that it was time to leave. I walked out of the reception intending to browse around in the bookstore. I took a look at the art books on the second floor, and then glanced at the new bestsellers and the business and travel books on the first floor. The bookstore was teeming with browsers. So people are still reading books. Terrific! &#x201c;The sweet smell of books in a literary society,&#x201d; I thought. As I made my way downstairs toward the basement, students were crowding both sides of the stairs, sitting and reading, almost as though they didn&#x2019;t want anyone else to go down there. Feeling cheerful, I picked my way down the stairs. The basement level is where &nbsp;the Sanlian keeps its extensive collection of books on literature, history, philosophy, politics, and the humanities, and that&#x2019;s why it&#x2019;s my number-one destination every time I visit. I&#x2019;ve always believed that the generous display of these humanities books is one of the things that make Beijing a city worth living in. A city that reads books on literature, history, philosophy, and politics is definitely a special place.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The basement level was very quiet that day. No one was around, and strangely enough, when I got down there I didn&#x2019;t really feel like browsing anymore. I just wanted to lay my hands on one particular book, but I couldn&#x2019;t remember what it was. I walked into the room thinking that when I saw it I would know. As I walked past the philosophy section and moved on to the politics and history sections, I suddenly felt I couldn&#x2019;t breathe. Was the basement air that bad?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I decided to make a quick exit. I was walking up the stairs trying not to bump into any of the youngsters, when suddenly somebody grabbed the cuff of my trousers. I looked down in surprise, and that person looked up at me. It was not one of the young people.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Lao Chen!&#x201d; She seemed surprised to see me.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Little Xi&#x201d; is all I said, but I was thinking, Little Xi, where have you been all these years?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I saw you go downstairs and I thought, that must be Lao Chen!&#x201d; From the way she said it she seemed to imply that running into me was quite important.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t you go up to the reception?&#x201d; I asked.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;No . . . I didn&#x2019;t know about it till I got here. Are you free now?&#x201d; She leaned toward me conspiratorially.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll buy you a cup of coffee.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She paused a minute before she said, &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s just walk and talk.&#x201d; Then she let go of my trouser leg.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We started strolling toward the National Art Museum. I walked beside her, waiting for her to start a conversation, but she didn&#x2019;t, so I asked her about her mother. &#x201c;How&#x2019;s Big Sister Song?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;She&#x2019;s fine.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;She must be over eighty now?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Yup.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;And how&#x2019;s your son?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No answer.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;How old is he?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Over twenty.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;That old?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yup.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Is he at university or working?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;He&#x2019;s at university. Look,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;can we change the subject?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remembered how much she doted on her son and was startled at her reaction. &nbsp;&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go to the Prime Hotel and have a cup of coffee,&#x201d; I offered.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She didn&#x2019;t want to, so we walked instead into the small park next to the National Art Museum.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Little Xi stopped suddenly. &#x201c;Lao Chen, have you noticed anything?&#x201d; she said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn&#x2019;t know how I should respond, but I knew I couldn&#x2019;t say, &#x201c;Noticed what?&#x201d; She seemed to be testing me. If I gave her the wrong answer, it was unlikely she&#x2019;d open up to me. As a writer, I like people to tell me their innermost thoughts. As a man, I wanted this woman to tell me her innermost thoughts.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I paused, feeling a little awkward, and she asked, &#x201c;Is it kind of hard for you to express your feelings?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I gave a small nod. I&#x2019;ve often felt nothing at all when people have asked how I feel about a work of art or a piece of music. I hate this feeling of feeling nothing, but I&#x2019;m pretty good at faking an acceptable response.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;That&#x2019;s great, I knew it,&#x201d; she went on. &#x201c;When I saw you going down the stairs, I thought to myself, Lao Chen will understand. Then I sat there waiting for you to come back up the stairs.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Little Xi&#x2019;s mind I&#x2019;m probably a reasonable, mature, and fairly knowledgeable person.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At least, that&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;d like people to think.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s sit down on this bench,&#x201d; I suggested gently.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It seemed to work, because after we sat down she relaxed, closed her eyes, sighed deeply, and said, &#x201c;At last.&#x201d;<br>Little Xi was definitely my type. After so many years, her looks and figure hadn&#x2019;t changed much, but wrinkles had begun to appear on her face from neglect. She also looked pretty depressed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She kept her eyes closed, trying to regain her composure. I looked at her intently and I suddenly realized how much I still liked this woman. I like melancholy women.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have anyone to talk to. I feel like there &nbsp;are fewer and fewer people like us . . . There are so few of us left that life hardly seems worth living anymore.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be silly,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Everybody&#x2019;s lonely, but no matter how lonely you are, life still goes on.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She ignored my banal response. &#x201c;No one remembers, except me. No one talks about it, except me. Does that mean I&#x2019;m completely mad? There&#x2019;s no trace of it, no evidence, so nobody can be bothered.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was enjoying the sound of her Beijing accent.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She briefly opened her eyes before closing them again. &#x201c;Well, how about it? We were such good friends. Why haven&#x2019;t I seen you for so many years? What happened?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I thought you&#x2019;d gone abroad.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She shook her head. &#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Well, it&#x2019;s good that you didn&#x2019;t. Now everybody&#x2019;s saying there&#x2019;s no country in the world as good as China.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She opened her eyes once more and gave me a look. I didn&#x2019;t really understand what she was getting at, so I didn&#x2019;t react. She broke into a smile and said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s unbelievable that you can still make jokes.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hadn&#x2019;t been joking, but I immediately went along with her and smiled, too.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You sound just like my son,&#x201d; she added.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Your son? You seem not to want to talk about him. What&#x2019;s up between the two of you?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;He&#x2019;s doing really well,&#x201d; she said in an ironic tone. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s studying law at Peking University and he&#x2019;s joined the Communist Party.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;That&#x2019;s good,&#x201d; I said vaguely. &#x201c;It will be useful when he tries to find a job.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;He wants to go into the Chinese Communist Party Central Propaganda Department!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At first I thought I hadn&#x2019;t heard her clearly.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;The Central Propaganda Department?&#x201d; I ventured.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Little Xi nodded. &#x201c;He says it&#x2019;s his life&#x2019;s ambition. He&#x2019;s got big ideas! If you ever meet him, you&#x2019;ll know what I mean.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was enjoying a feeling of happiness sitting there next to Little Xi. It was such a beautiful spring afternoon; the sun was so bright and warm that many elderly couples were strolling around the park. There were also a few smokers . . . smokers? Two of them were standing close by chain-smoking. I like to read detective stories and I&#x2019;ve even written a few myself, and so this situation left plenty of room for the imagination. It could have been a surveillance scene, but as I was nothing more than a self-indulgent writer of very ordinary bestsellers, why would anyone want to spy on me? Wherever there are people in China there are smokers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I listened as Little Xi continued to pour her heart out to me. &#x201c;Am I causing trouble, making a fuss? I know it&#x2019;s none of my business, but I can&#x2019;t act just like nothing&#x2019;s happened. How can things change just like that? I don&#x2019;t get it and I can&#x2019;t stand it.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was still wondering what had made her so upset. Her son, or the after-effects of her own nightmarish experiences?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;One day in a small restaurant in Lanqiying,&#x201d; she said, looking directly at me, &#x201c;I went on a blind date with one of you Taiwanese men&#x2014;he was a businessman.

I was enraptured by the book, with its guides to doing just about everything under the sun &#x2013; from playing guitar to making toothpaste &#x2013; and by the use of the original layouts. I learnt about Hot Iron Press through the book. Unfortunately Hot Iron Press was in an area of New Orleans badly damaged by Hurricane Katrina &#x2013; and the collapsing levees &#x2013; during the Summer of 2005. I emailed Kyle to see if he would be willing to answer some questions about how Katrina had affected them, their reaction to Hot Iron Press being badly damaged and what the future held after the damage."&#x2014;<i>Last Hours</i> #13 Interview Introduction<br><br>"Quite some time ago, Kyle Bravo put together a couple of issues of a zine called <i>How2Zine</i>.

Included in the motley group is the ugstabuggle, "a monster nearly nine feet tall / With hairy, grasping hands" who conveniently disappears when you stop thinking of him. The Marog from Mars has "a body of brass / And seventeen fingers and toes" and would make an entire classroom shriek, if anyone could see him. And the "great huge horrible horrible / creeping up the stars" is, well, HORRIBLE. Rees's watercolors of wide-eyed children and twitchy goblins are just frightening enough to provide thrills without causing nightmares. A mixture of such British and American poets as e. e. cummings, Lilian Moore, Ted Hughes and Shel Silverstein provides verses bound to provoke shivers and giggles.

I'd miss any one of them too much if I asked someone else to do them for me. I may work by myself, but I'm not alone. I'm in the company of stone."</i><p> Daniel Snow is a waller, an artisan who builds walls, terraces, caverns, and the occasional sphere or pool out of dry stone. It's an ancient skill--building with only what the earth provides. No mortar, no nails, nothing to hold his creations together except gravity, an invisible glue he can sense in the stones' "conversations" of squeaks and rumbles. A hollow sound means a void needs to be filled; a solid fit is secured with the sound of a bolt being thrown. Snow's evocative prose and Peter Mauss's richly textured photographs of Snow's work reveal the nuance and beauty of walling--and of one man's relationship with nature. The result is by turns poetic and practical.</p><p></p></p><p>Dan Snow builds stone walls without benefit of mortar or other binding material. This ancient dry-stone method is experiencing a revival, and Snow's <i>In the Company of Stone</i> is full of moody photos of recent landscape projects, some of which look as if they'd been part of the scenery for centuries. Snow's poetic commentary and a helpful appendix of design detail make for an inspiring, informative book.These walls were built out of necessity, or by way of that motherless invention known as art.

Visit Jana on her website, www.janadeleon.com.The fall sun was already beginning to set above the cypress trees on Tuesday evening, when Colette Guidry parked her car in front of the quaint home in Vodoun, Louisiana. An attractive wooden sign that read Second Chance Detective Agency was already placed in front of a beautifully landscaped flower bed, but the sounds of hammering and stacks of lumber on the front lawn let her know that the office conversion wasn't exactly complete.<p>She reached for the door handle and paused. Maybe this was a bad idea. She'd worked with Alexandria Bastin-Chamberlain, one of the partners at the detective agency, at the hospital in New Orleans before Alex resigned to open the agency with her husband. She shouldn't feel self-conscious about asking for her help.</p><p><i>But what if Alex thinks you're crazy, too?</i></p><p>And that was at the crux of it. The rest of the hospital staff and the New Orleans Police Department had already informed her that her concern over her missing employee was misplaced. Anna Huval had a history of skipping town with undesirable men and usually surfaced when the disastrous relationship had run its short course. Colette had intimate understanding of choosing the wrong man, although her choices hadn't been near as wild or frequent as Anna's. But her two disappointing whirls with noncommittal men had given her enough sorrow to be sympathetic to Anna's heartbreak, even if it was self-induced.</p><p>But all that was in the past. With Colette's guidance, Anna had turned her life around, and for the past six months, she had been on a path that guaranteed her a healthy, successful future. The only problem was no one believed it would last, and Anna's disappearance was a signal to many that she'd relapsed into the behavior that was so familiar to her.</p><p>Colette understood exactly why people felt that way. Logically, it was the best explanation, and if Colette hadn't gotten to know Anna so well, she would have bought completely into it, also. But despite the lack of evidence of something dire, and a seemingly logical explanation for what had happened given Anna's past, Colette knew something terrible had happened to the young nurse's aide.</p><p>She pushed the car door open and stepped out. The detective agency specialized in situations the police wouldn't handle&#x2014;giving concerned friends and family a second chance for answers. Anna's disappearance fit that description. If Alex and her husband, Holt, didn't think her case had merit, then they'd tell her, and that would be that.</p><p>The door to the agency was partially open, so she pushed it a bit farther and stuck her head inside. Alex stood talking to a contractor in the middle of what was probably going to be a reception area once it had paint, flooring and furniture. As the sunlight crept in through the open door, her former coworker looked over and waved when she saw Colette.</p><p>"Did you come to take my temperature?" Alex asked as Colette stepped inside.</p><p>"Why? Are you sick?"</p><p>"I must be to think I could handle the construction management myself."</p><p>Colette laughed. "Well, I'm hardly going to accuse a psychiatrist of being crazy, so sick it is. Perhaps a mindaltering flu."</p><p>"Sounds lovely," Alex said and pointed to the only portion of the house away from the loud saws and other construction equipment. "My office is this way. It's the only place with decent flooring and chairs." She leaned over and whispered, "Plus, I have the gourmet single-serve coffeemaker hidden in my filing cabinet."</p><p>Colette felt her spirits rise as she followed Alex into a pretty office with blue walls and white trim located in a corner of the building. In addition to being intelligent, attractive and empathetic, Alex was the most intuitive person she'd ever met. If there was help to be found, she'd find it here.</p><p>She took a seat in front of the desk and made small talk while Alex made them coffee, catching her up on all the hospital gossip since she'd resigned the month before. Then Alex slid into the chair behind her desk and gave her a shrewd look.</p><p>"While I am very happy to see you, I doubt you drove all the way to Vodoun to bring me up to speed on the latest inner workings of New Orleans General."</p><p>"No. I have a problem...one I'm hoping you can help me with."</p><p>Alex pulled a pad of paper and pen out of her desk drawer. "Tell me."</p><p>"Anna Huval didn't report to work on Friday. She was scheduled for the evening shift, but was a no-show/ no-call."</p><p>"You tried to reach her, of course."</p><p>"Yes. I called her apartment and her cell. When I didn't get an answer, I checked with the emergency room of all area hospitals, then when I came up empty there, I called the police. Fortunately, they had no Jane Does in the morgue that matched Anna's description, and they let me file a report but said they probably wouldn't look into it until Monday. Yesterday."</p><p>Alex nodded. "Because most adults turn up within twenty-four to forty-eight hours and haven't been victims of a crime."</p><p>"Exactly."</p><p>"So did they investigate on Monday?"</p><p>"I pestered them and they finally agreed to check her apartment. I'd already tried to get in but the landlord has gotten in trouble for letting unauthorized people into apartments before and wasn't budging."</p><p>"Did you find anything inside?"</p><p>"No sign of forced entry or a struggle, and her backpack was missing. Since she started nursing school, she carries it with her everywhere, sneaking in study time whenever she can." Colette frowned. "But the thing is, her books were on her bed. Scattered like they'd been tossed there in a hurry. The bed itself was still made."</p><p>"Could you tell if any clothes were missing?"</p><p>Colette shook her head. "I don't know. There were no large gaps in her closet, so if she intended to leave, she didn't take much, but then, she didn't have much to begin with."</p><p>"Tell me more about her cell phone."</p><p>"She has a prepaid one that I've been calling every couple of hours, but it goes straight to voice mail. The police called the cell-phone company to track it, but they said it's either turned off or not in range."</p><p>"Did the police find any other reason to suspect she'd taken off on her own volition?"</p><p>Colette struggled with her own frustration and disappointment. Now that she was repeating the facts out loud, she could see exactly why the New Orleans police weren't taking her seriously, and the next bit of information was not going to make the situation any better.</p><p>"Colette?"</p><p>She sighed. "Her bank said she withdrew four hundred dollars on Friday evening, a couple of hours before her shift was due to start."</p><p>Alex raised her eyebrows and tapped her pen on the desk.</p><p>"I know how this looks," Colette said. "If you take the facts and couple them with Anna's reputation for hooking up with the wrong men, then you have a foolish girl adding one more wild weekend to a very colorful past. But I promise you, that is not the young woman Anna is now."</p><p>"How can you be sure?"</p><p>"Well, I suppose no one can be one hundred percent sure, but I've worked with her every week for the last year. When she told me she wanted to turn her life around, I got her counseling with hospital staff as a start. After three months of therapy, she told me she wanted to be a nurse, and I helped her get grants for nursing school. She comes to me with questions on her courses, and I can see her interest and focus clear as day."</p><p>"Maybe a family emergency."</p><p>"She's always claimed she has no family left, and I've never seen evidence of any since I've known her. Besides, if it was an emergency, why wouldn't she call me? She trusts me. She knows I would help."</p><p>"Perhaps it's not the sort of emergency you would help with."</p><p>"What do you mean?"</p><p>Alex sighed. "I know a little about Anna&#x2014;some from the rumor mill at the hospital, some from Anna herself. If she's involved in something she knows you wouldn't approve of, she wouldn't tell you. It's clear from what you've told me that she respects you, and I got the impression that with Anna, respect doesn't come lightly. If she thought telling you would damage that, she may choose to handle it alone."</p><p>Colette slumped back in her chair. Everything Alex said made so much sense. "But that doesn't mean she's not in trouble, whether or not she chose to walk into it."</p><p>"That's true."</p><p>"So will you take the case? I have the money, and Anna's become...well, like a little sister to me. I have to do something."</p><p>"Of course you do," Alex said, and Colette could tell by her expression that Alex truly did understand.</p><p>Alex was the only person at New Orleans General whom Colette had ever confided in about the boating accident that killed her parents when she was young and being raised by her only living relative, a spinster aunt who never wanted children and who'd died years ago. More than anyone else, Alex knew the loss she felt at having no family and would understand why Anna had become so important to her.</p><p>"I have no problem with our taking the case," Alex said.</p><p>Relief swept over Colette like a wave. "Thank you. I can't even tell you how much this means that someone is actually listening."</p><p>Alex leaned forward in her chair and looked directly at Colette. "But you have to be prepared for whatever we find&#x2014;even if it's not the answer you wanted."</p><p>Colette nodded. "I can handle that. I just can't handle doing nothing."</p><p>"Good. As it happens, Holt's half brother Max is starting at the agency this week. I'll get all the information from you and bring him up to speed at dinner tonight."</p><p>"Holt's half brother?" Colette struggled to control her disap...</p></p><h2>The Raider (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)</h2><p>Beautiful Jessica Taggert does not realize that the fearless, masked patriot she loves and the despised Alexander Montgomery, the drunken town buffoon, are the same man, in a romance set against colonial New England</p><p><b>Jude Deveraux </b>is the author of&nbsp;more than forty <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers, including <i>Moonlight in the Morning</i>, <i>The Scent of Jasmine, Scarlet Nights, Days of Gold, Lavender Morning, Return to Summerhouse, </i>and <i>Secrets. </i>To date, there are more than sixty million copies of her books in print worldwide.

Alex had never seen anyone with quite as much arrogance as this Russian.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have your head if you misplace my buckles a second time,&#x201d; Nick said with his heavy accent and husky voice.<br> <br>Alex wondered if in Russia grand dukes were still allowed to behead people who displeased them.<br> <br>&#x201c;Go now. Out of my sight,&#x201d; Nick said as he waved a lace-encased wrist toward the cowering servant. &#x201c;You see what I have to bear,&#x201d; he said to Alex as soon as they were alone in the cabin.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a great deal, yes, I can see that,&#x201d; Alex agreed.<br> <br>Nicholas raised one eyebrow at his friend, then looked back at the charts spread across the table. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll be docking about a hundred and fifty miles south of this Warbrooke of yours. Think someone will be willing to take you north?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll manage,&#x201d; Alex said nonchalantly, putting his hands behind his head and stretching even more, his long body taking up most of the cabin space. Long ago he&#x2019;d schooled his handsome face to conceal what he was thinking. Nicholas knew some of what his friend was feeling, but Alex didn&#x2019;t allow anyone to see the depth of his concern.<br> <br>Months ago, while Alex was in Italy, he&#x2019;d received a letter from his sister Marianna begging him to come home. She had said that he was desperately needed. She had told Alex what their father had forbidden her to tell: that he, Sayer Montgomery, had been badly injured in an accident aboard a ship and his legs had been crushed. They hadn&#x2019;t expected him to live, but he had and he was confined to his bed now, a cripple.<br> <br>Marianna had gone on to say that she had married an Englishman, the customs inspector for the little town of Warbrooke, and he was...She hadn&#x2019;t gone into detail of what her husband was doing, probably because she was caught between loyalty to her husband and loyalty to her family and the townspeople she&#x2019;d known all her life. But Alex could sense that there was much that she wasn&#x2019;t telling him.<br> <br>She&#x2019;d given the letter to one of the many seamen in Warbrooke and hoped that it would reach Alex and that he could come home. Alex had received the letter soon after he&#x2019;d docked in Italy. The schooner he&#x2019;d sailed out of Warbrooke on over four years ago had gone down three weeks before and he&#x2019;d been waiting on Italy&#x2019;s sunny coast, not trying very hard to find another position as ship&#x2019;s officer.<br> <br>It was in Italy that he&#x2019;d met Nicholas Ivanovitch. Nick&#x2019;s family in Russia was first cousins with the tzarina, and Nick expected people the world over to be aware of this fact and to treat him with the awe and subservience that he thought his position gave him.<br> <br>Alex had stepped in and saved Nick&#x2019;s thick neck from a gang of roving sailors who didn&#x2019;t like what Nick had said about them. Alex had pulled his sword, tossed it to Nick, and then drawn two knives, one for each hand, from his belt. Together the two men had fought back.<br> <br>It had taken them an hour, and when they were finished, they were covered with blood, their clothes were in shreds, but they were friends. Alexander was treated to the Russian hospitality that was as generous as the Russian arrogance. Nick took Alex aboard his private ship, a lugger, a ship that was so fast that it was illegal in most countries since it could outrun anything on the seas. But no one bothered the Russian aristocracy since they followed no laws but their own.<br> <br>Alex settled down on the opulent ship and for a couple of days enjoyed being waited on, his every wish anticipated, his every wish fulfilled by the army of cowering servants that Nick had brought with him from Russia.<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re not like this in America,&#x201d; Alex had told Nick after his fifth mug of ale. He talked of the independence of Americans, of their ability to create their own country from a wilderness. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve fought the French, the Indians, we&#x2019;ve fought all the world and we&#x2019;ve won!&#x201d; The more he drank, the more he rhapsodized about the glories of America. After he and Nick had put away most of a keg of ale, Nick brought out a clear liquid he called vodka and they started on that. Say nothing else about the Russians, Alex thought, they can drink with the best of them.<br> <br>It was the next morning, when Alex&#x2019;s head was splitting and his mouth tasted as if he&#x2019;d just licked the bottom of a ship clean, that the letter arrived. Nick was topside, taking his bellyache out on his cringing servants, when Elias Downey asked permission to come aboard and talk to Alexander. Nick was diverted from his shouting and complaining long enough to escort the man downstairs&#x2014;he was dying of curiosity to hear what this man&#x2019;s message of great importance was.<br> <br>Alex merely rolled his eyes when Nick poured three glasses of vodka and set them on the table.<br> <br>Alex ignored the roaring in his head as he listened to the tales Elias had to tell about what was happening in Warbrooke. He scanned the letter from his sister, but there was much that she&#x2019;d not told him.<br> <br>&#x201c;That man she married is evil. He steals from all of us,&#x201d; Elias was saying. &#x201c;He took Josiah&#x2019;s ship from him, said he thought there was contraband on it. He done it all legal and proper like, weren&#x2019;t nothin&#x2019; any of us could do to stop him. If Josiah could come up with sixty pounds, he could sue your brother-in-law to get his ship back. That ship was all that Josiah had in the world and now he ain&#x2019;t even got that.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What did my father do?&#x201d; Alex asked, leaning forward. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t imagine him letting his son-in-law take a man&#x2019;s ship.&#x201d;<br> <br>Elias&#x2019;s eyelids were beginning to droop with the effects of Nick&#x2019;s vodka. &#x201c;Sayer ain&#x2019;t got no legs. They might as well have been cut off. He just stays in bed. Nobody expected him to live but he did&#x2014;if you can call that livin&#x2019;. He lays in bed, won&#x2019;t even hardly eat nothin&#x2019;. Eleanor Taggert runs the place.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Taggert!&#x201d; Alex scoffed. &#x201c;They still live in that backwater shack, still trying to control those damned kids of theirs?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;James went down with his ship a couple of years ago and Nancy died havin&#x2019; the last young one. A few of the boys shipped out, but there&#x2019;s enough of &#x2019;em left behind. Eleanor works for your father and Jess runs a boat around the harbor. They keep the family eatin&#x2019;. Of course, you know the Taggerts, they won&#x2019;t take charity from nobody. That Jess, she&#x2019;s somethin&#x2019;. She&#x2019;s the only one that&#x2019;ll stand up to your brother-in-law. &#x2019;Course it ain&#x2019;t as if the Taggerts have anything to lose by standin&#x2019; up to him. They don&#x2019;t own nothin&#x2019; that anybody&#x2019;d want.&#x201d;<br> <br>Alex exchanged smiles with Elias. The Taggerts were the town joke. They were used as contrast to everyone&#x2019;s bad luck. No matter what happened to you, you could always look at the Taggerts and see somebody worse off than you were. They were poorer than anyone else, and dirtier&#x2014;and they covered their misery with pride.<br> <br>&#x201c;Is Jessica still as hot tempered as she always was?&#x201d; Alex murmured, smiling at the memory of a scrawny, dirty-faced brat who, for some reason he had never understood, had singled him out to make his life miserable. &#x201c;She must be about twenty now, right?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;There abouts.&#x201d; Elias&#x2019;s eyes were beginning to close.<br> <br>&#x201c;And still not married?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nobody wants them kids,&#x201d; Elias said, his voice beginning to slur. &#x201c;You ain&#x2019;t seen Jess in a long time. She&#x2019;s changed.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Somehow I doubt that,&#x201d; Alex said just as Elias&#x2019;s head slumped forward onto his chest and he fell asleep. Alex looked up at Nick. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have to go back and see what this is about. Marianna asks me to come home and help them. I doubt if it&#x2019;s as bad as they make it seem. My father has always believed the town of Warbrooke to be his personal little fiefdom and now he&#x2019;s having to share the authority with someone else and he doesn&#x2019;t like it. And if one of those Taggerts is sticking his nose in it and stirring up trouble, it&#x2019;s no wonder there&#x2019;s a commotion. I&#x2019;ll go back and see what it is. I heard of a ship leaving for America in about six weeks&#x2019; time. Maybe the captain doesn&#x2019;t have his crew yet.&#x201d;<br> <br>Nick tossed back the last of the vodka. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take you. My parents wanted me to see America and I have cousins there. I&#x2019;ll take you to this town of yours and you can see what is going on. A son should obey his father.&#x201d;<br> <br>Alex smiled at Nick and didn&#x2019;t show how concerned he was about his father&#x2019;s injury. He couldn&#x2019;t imagine his big, loud, demanding father being an invalid confined to bed. &#x201c;All right,&#x201d; Alex said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be happy to go with you.&#x201d;<br> <br>That had been weeks ago, and now they were within hours of docking and Alex was looking forward to seeing his homeland again.<br> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br> <br>The town of New Sussex was booming with business. There was the noise of the ships docking, of people shouting and hawking wares, of arguments. And there were the odors of dead fish and unwashed people, mixed with clean, pure sea air.<br> <br>Nick stretched his big body and yawned, the sun reflecting off the gold embroidery of his jacket. &#x201c;You are welcome to stay with my cousin. He has nothing much to do and he will be glad of the diversion of you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Thanks just the same but I think I&#x2019;ll start home,&#x201d; Alex answered. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m anxious to see my father again and to see what mischief my sister has gotten herself into.&#x201d;<br> <br>They parted at the dock, Alex carrying only one bag across his shoulder. First he planned to purchase a horse and then a new suit of clothes. Everything he owned had gone down in Italy and after he&#x2019;d met Nick, he&#x2019;d worn nothing but the comfortable, baggy pants and shirt of seaman&#x2019;s gear.<br> <br>&#x201c;Here! Watch that!&#x201d; a British soldier, one of a group of six, yelled at Alex. &#x201c;Scum like you should look out for your betters.&#x201d;<br> <br>Alex had no time to defend himself before one of the men pushed him from behind. The bag Alex carried fell forward just as the soldier pushed him again. Alex fell face down into the dirt, his ears ringing with laughter as he spit out dirt and debris.<br> <br>He was on his feet in seconds and starting for the group of soldiers who&#x2019;d already turned their backs when a strong hand stopped him. &#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t if I were you.&#x201d;<br> <br>Alex was so angry that at first he couldn&#x2019;t focus on the sailor beside him.<br> <br>&#x201c;They have the right, and you&#x2019;ll only get into more trouble if you go after them.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What do you mean they have the right?&#x201d; Alex said through his teeth. Now that he was upright, his senses were returning to him. There were six of them and one of him.<br> <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re soldiers of His Majesty and they have every right to do what they want. You&#x2019;ll get yourself thrown in jail if you fool with the likes of them.&#x201d; When Alex made no reply, the sailor shrugged and kept on walking.<br> <br>Alex, after a moment of glaring at the soldiers&#x2019; backs, reshouldered his bag and kept walking. He tried to return his thoughts to clean clothes and a good horse between his legs.<br> <br>As he passed a tavern, he caught a whiff of fish chowder and realized he was hungry. Within minutes, he was seated at a dirty table and eating savory stew from a deep wooden bowl, remembering meals with Nick. They had eaten with gold utensils off porcelain plates so thin they were transparent.<br> <br>He wasn&#x2019;t prepared when he felt the sharp tip of a sword at his throat. He looked up to see the same soldier who&#x2019;d pushed him into the dirt moments before.<br> <br>&#x201c;So here is our little sailor again,&#x201d; the man taunted. &#x201c;I thought you&#x2019;d be long gone by now.&#x201d; The young soldier&#x2019;s face changed from teasing to serious. &#x201c;Get up. This is our table.&#x201d;<br> <br>Alex&#x2019;s hands moved slowly toward the underside of the table. He didn&#x2019;t have a weapon on him, but he had skill and speed. Before the soldiers knew what was happening, Alex sent the table toward them, knocking the first man down and landing so heavily on his leg that he screamed in pain. The other five attacked Alex at once.<br> <br>He managed to knock two of them out, then grabbed the handle of the heavy pot hanging over the fire. It burned his hands, but it also burned the entire midsection of the man he tossed it to. He was just about to bring a chair down on the head of the fifth man when the innkeeper hit Alex over the head with a tankard.<br> <br>Alex sank to the floor gracefully.<br> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br> <br>A bucket of cold, dirty water was splashed on Alex&#x2019;s face, and he came to painfully. His head was roaring and it was difficult to open his eyes. Based upon the smell of the place, he was sure he was in hell.<br> <br>&#x201c;Get up. You&#x2019;re free,&#x201d; came a gruff voice as Alex tried to sit up. He managed to open one eye but closed it again against the dazzle.<br> <br>&#x201c;Alex,&#x201d; came a voice he recognized as being Nick&#x2019;s. &#x201c;I came to get you out of this filthy place, but I&#x2019;ll be damned if I&#x2019;m going to carry you. Get up and follow me.&#x201d;<br> <br>The dazzle had been the several pounds of gold embroidery on Nick&#x2019;s uniform. Alex realized his friend was wearing one of the several uniforms he used whenever he wanted something from someone. Nick had said that people the world over were impressed with the gaudiness of the Russian uniforms and it got him what he wanted. Alex also knew that Nick wasn&#x2019;t about to dirty that uniform by giving his friend a hand.<br> <br>In spite of the fact that Alex&#x2019;s head was about to fall off his shoulders, he managed to hold it on and stand up. He was beginning to see that he was in a jail, a filthy place with ancient straw on the stone floor and heaven knew what in the corners. The wall he touched was cold and slimy and the slime coated his hands.<br> <br>Somehow, he managed to follow Nick&#x2019;s perfectly straight back out of the building and into the fading daylight. A magnificent carriage and equally magnificent horses awaited them. One of Nick&#x2019;s servants helped Alex into the carriage.<br> <br>Alex was hardly seated when Nick began raging at him.<br> <br>&#x201c;Did you know that they planned to hang you in the morning?&#x201d; he growled. &#x201c;I only heard about you by chance. Some old sailor saw you get off my ship and then get knocked around by those soldiers. He saw you kick the table over on one of them. Did you know you broke his leg? He may lose it. And you burned one of them and a third one still hasn&#x2019;t waked up after you bashed him. Alex, a person in your station in life can&#x2019;t do that sort of thing.&#x201d;<br> <br>Alex raised an eyebrow at that statement. No doubt Nick, in his station in life, would have every right to do what he pleased.<br> <br>Alex leaned back against the seat and looked out the window while Nick continued to tell him that he couldn&#x2019;t do what he&#x2019;d done. While Nick was talking, Alex saw an English soldier grab a young girl&#x2019;s arm and pull her behind a building.<br> <br>&#x201c;Stop here,&#x201d; Alex said.<br> <br>Nick, who had seen what Alex had, refused to have the driver stop the carriage and when Alex tried to get out anyway, Nick pushed him forcefully against the seat. Alex grabbed his head in pain.<br> <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re only peasants,&#x201d; Nick said, his voice full of disbelief.<br> <br>&#x201c;But they are my peasants,&#x201d; Alex whispered.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ah, yes, now I begin to understand. But there are always more peasants. They breed rapidly.&#x201d;<br> <br>Alex didn&#x2019;t bother to answer Nick&#x2019;s absurdities. His head was hurting as much from what he&#x2019;d seen as from the blow he&#x2019;d received. He&#x2019;d heard rumors of horrors that were going on in America, but he hadn&#x2019;t really believed them. In England there was talk of the ungrateful Colonists, how they were like delinquent children who needed a firm hand to rule them. He&#x2019;d even seen American ships being unloaded and inspected before they ...</p><h2>More Than Conqueror (The Grace Livingston Hill Ser : N0.11)</h2><p>When Charlie Montgomery, a handsome soldier, declares his love for Blythe Bonniwell, she realizes she should be offended.

For over 150 years, beginning with the U.S. Navy&#x2019;s capture of the city for the United States in the opening days of the Mexican War, the navy has been an indelible part of San Diego&#x2019;s lifestyle, culture, and vitality. Not only has the navy formed the bedrock of the region&#x2019;s economy, but it has helped shape the population while endowing the city with a sense of international and cosmopolitan awareness that separates San Diego from many other cities of its size.

A young boy determines to rescue a poor baby dragon who is being used by a group of lazy wild animals to ferry them across the river on Wild Island.</p><p><i>My Father's Dragon</i>--a favorite of young readers since the 1940s and a Newbery honor book--captures the nonsensical logic of childhood in an amusingly deadpan fashion. The story begins when Elmer Elevator (the narrator's father as a boy) runs away with an old alley cat to rescue a flying baby dragon being exploited on a faraway island. With the help of two dozen pink lollipops, rubber bands, chewing gum, and a fine-toothed comb, Elmer disarms the fiercest of beasts on Wild Island. The quirky, comical adventure ends with a heroic denouement: the freeing of the dragon. Abundant black-and-white lithographs by Ruth Chrisman Gannett (the author's stepmother) add an evocative, lighthearted mood to an already enchanting story. Author Ruth Stiles Gannett 's stand-alone sequel, <i>Elmer and the Dragon,</i> and her third volume, <i>The Dragons of Blueland</i> both received starred reviews in <i>School Library Journal</i> and are as fresh and original as her first. <i>(Ages 4 to 8)</i>When Elmer Elevator hears about the plight of an overworked and underappreciated baby flying dragon, he stows away on a ship and travels to Wild Island to rescue the dragon.</p><h2>Reptiles and Amphibians Dictionary: An A to Z of Cold-Blooded Creatures</h2><p>Facts and information on a wide array of reptiles and amphibians.</p><p></p><h2>The Vision of Emma Blau</h2><p>From the critically acclaimed author of Stones from the River comes an intriguing new novel of immigration and love, following a German man who flees to the U.S. at the start of the century and makes a life for himself, spawning four generations of descendants.</p><p>Ursula Hegi's <i>The Vision of Emma Blau</i> is an epic story of German immigrants attempting to assimilate while still preserving traces of home in their language and rituals. In 1894 Stefan Blau leaves Europe for America; he is only 13 years old, but he feels the need for another country so strongly that it wakes him up at night. After narrowly escaping a restaurant fire in New York City, he finds himself in New Hampshire. With money he has saved from waiter jobs and poker winnings, he buys a small hotel, which over time he transforms into a six-story, elaborate apartment house. The <i>Wasserburg</i> (water fortress) is a palace towering over a half-empty lake town, standing out in the landscape the same way Stefan's accent stands out in conversation--exotic, awkward, a hybrid of German and American dreams.<p> Hegi's writing is lively and graceful, moving across time, space, and generations without faltering or bogging down. While her scope is vast, her great gift is for particulars: Stefan's third wife, Helene, who has a deep-seated aggression in her soul that her mother attributed to her being a "biter" as a child; his daughter, Greta, who lags in school but notices things no one else does--"the reflection of the half moon that swayed on the water like a slab of frost," or the music of her flute--"long notes that sounded like the calls of large birds flying through the night." These moments of poetry open up <i>The Vision of Emma Blau</i>, halting its swirling world with their loveliness.</p><p> Hegi is best known for her 1994 novel, <i>Stones from the River</i>, which Oprah chose for her book group, catapulting this somewhat obscure writer onto the bestseller lists. But Hegi was around for a long time before Oprah shined the light on her. She is a born storyteller, a witness to the immigrant experience who is reimagining America's past from the perspective of those who desired that country as a promised land, but who even after 100 years could never quite sleep the sleep of its native sons. <i>--Emily White</i></p><b>Ursula Hegi</b> is the author of <i>The Worst Thing I've Done, Sacred Time</i>, <i>Hotel of the Saints</i>, <i>The Vision of Emma Blau</i>, <i>Tearing the Silence</i>, <i>Salt Dancers</i>, <i>Stones from the River</i>, <i>Floating in My Mother's Palm</i>, <i>Unearned Pleasures and Other Stories</i>, <i>Intrusions</i>, and <i>Trudi &amp; Pia</i>.

The United States became an increasingly urban culture as people left their farms to seek work in the cities. Many blacks moved North to escape the violence and racism of a resurgent Ku Klux Klan in the South. And, while life became more comfortable for many Americans during this period, by 1941 only half the population enjoyed the modern conveniences we now take for granted. With improvements in technology and the rise of consumerism (spurred by the new &#34;science&#34; of advertising) the country was expanding in every direction. However, for many Americans, daily life was fraught with uncertainty. Jobs and wages were unpredictable, labor unrest was constant, and savings vanished in the stock market. In this vividly detailed narrative, Harvey Green recounts an era of unprecedented change in American culture and examines the impact of these uncertain times on such aspects of daily life as employment, home life, gender roles, education, religion, and recreation.</p><p>A vibrant account of life in the United States during the turbulent times of the Jazz Age, the Depression, and the two world wars--the fifth book in the <i>Everyday Life in America</i> series.Harvey Green is a professor of history at Northeastern University.

But a climate of fear surrounds Faustina, and after several strange incidents which defy rational explanation, she is forced to resign. Gisela asks her fiance, detective-psychologist Dr Basil Willing, to investigate.

Shortly after her return to the US she published her first novel, <em>Dance of Death</em>, in 1933, featuring her popular series detective-psychologist Basil Willing. The novel <em>Through a Glass Darkly</em>, a puzzle in the supernatural tradition of John Dickson Carr, is the eighth in the Basil Willing series and is generally acknowledged to be her masterpiece. In 1946 McCloy married fellow author Davis Dresser, famed for his Mike Shayne novels. Together they founded Halliday &amp; McCloy literary agency as well as the Torquil Publishing Company.

But how many casual observers - or advocates, for that matter - are aware that the roots of this movement extend deep into Western history?Even before launching the great campaign to attain universal suffrage, strong female voices spoke in favor of the social, political, educational, and economic rights of women. A Vindication of the Rights of Women, published in the late eighteenth century, is truly a classic in this venerable tradition. Railing against the stubborn social forces that confined women to an inferior station in the community, Mary Wollstonecraft declares war on the prevailing attitudes and customs that prevent women from realizing their individual potential.</p><p>In this passionate reaction to Rousseau&#39;s pedagogical work Emile (1762) Wollstonecraft powerfully defends woman&#39;s ability to reason, given appropriate education. Her radical prescription was for girls to be educated alongside boys and to the same standard. Originally published in 1792, this is a foundational work of feminist political thought.Founded in 1906 by J.M.

Machines that saw wood can be very interesting, even though in the wrong hands they can be the cause of ghastly accidents. </p> <p> And for Klaus, who enjoys reading immensely, perhaps there will be a library. Information found in a book can be very useful. Especially if an evil doctor is lurking about. </p> <p> And for Sunny, who likes nothing better than to bite things with her four sharp teeth, perhaps there will be bark to chew. It is important to keep teeth sharp when someone close by may be hiding a sword. </p> <p> As the train pulls into the station, one thing is certain: The unlucky Baudelaire orphans had best keep their teeth, wits, and minds sharp, for whatever awaits them at the mill may well be the deadliest in a series of unfortunate events. </p></p><p>Fans of Lemony Snicket's wonderful Series of Unfortunate Events won't be surprised to find that in the sixth installment the three Baudelaire orphans' new home proves to be something of a mixed bag. As our ever sad but helpful narrator states, "Although 'a mixed bag' sometimes refers to a plastic bag that has been stirred in a bowl, more often it is used to describe a situation that has both good parts and bad parts. An afternoon at the movie theater, for instance, would be a mixed bag if your favorite movie were showing, but if you had to eat gravel instead of popcorn. A trip to the zoo would be a very mixed bag if the weather were beautiful, but all of the man-and woman-eating lions were running around loose." And so it is for the bad-luck Baudelaires. Their fancy new 71-bedroom home on 667 Dark Avenue is inhabited by Esm� Gigi Geniveve Squalor (the city's sixth most important financial advisor), and her kindly husband, Jerome, who doesn't like to argue. Esm� is obsessed by the trends du jour (orphans are "in"), and because elevators are "out," Sunny, Violet, and Klaus have to trudge up 66 flights of stairs to reach the Squalors' penthouse apartment. (Other unfortunate trends include pinstripe suits, aqueous martinis--water with a faint olive-y taste--parsley soda, and ocean decorations.) <p> As the book begins, the Baudelaires are not only frightened in anticipation of their next (inevitable) encounter with the evil, moneygrubbing Count Olaf but they are also mourning the disappearance of their dear new friends from <i>The Austere Academy</i>, the Quagmires. It doesn't take long for Olaf to show up in another of his horrific disguises... but if he is on Dark Avenue, what has he done with the Quagmires? Once again, the resourceful orphans use their unique talents (Violet's inventions, Klaus's research skills, and the infant Sunny's strong teeth) in a fruitless attempt to escape from terrible tragedy. Is there a gleam of hope for the orphans and their new friends? Most certainly not. The only thing we can really count on are more gloriously gloomy adventures in the seventh book, <i>The Vile Village</i>. (Ages 9 and older) <i>--Karin Snelson</i></p><p>I hope, for your sake, that you have not chosen to read this book because you are in the mood for a pleasant experience. If this is the case, I advise you to put this book down instantaneously, because of all the books describing the unhappy lives of the Baudelaire orphans, The Miserable Mill might be the unhappiest yet. Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire are sent to Paltryville to work in a lumber mill, and they find disaster and misfortune lurking behind every log. The pages of this book, I&#x2032;m sorry to inform you, contain such unpleasantries as a giant pincher machine, a bad casserole, a man with a cloud of smoke where his head should be, a hypnotist, a terrible accident resulting in injury, and coupons. I have promised to write down the entire history of these three poor children, but you haven&#x2032;t, so if you prefer stories that are more heartwarming, please feel free to make another selection.</p><p> With all due respect,</p><p> Lemony Snicket</p><p> Ages 10+</p></p><h2>Crise De LA Conscience Europeenne</h2><p>Hard to Find book</p><p>Text: French</p><h2>The Hobbit: A Graphic Novel (#1 of 3)</h2><p>Book one of three.

When spiritual emergencies, such as mystical psychosis and dark nights of the soul, are understood, managed, and integrated, they can offer enormous potential for growth and fulfillment, and this book offers three key phases for successful navigation. Encouraging, supportive, and life-saving, this resource is essential for avoiding the mental, emotional, or spiritual paralysis or exhaustion that can result from underestimating the current age of increased individual and global emergencies.</p><p>Catherine G. Lucas is the founding director of the UK Spiritual Crisis Network. She has organized international conferences on spiritual emergency, is a regular speaker on the subject, and runs workshops on mindfulness and spirituality."This book is going to be very helpful to many people.", <i>Dr Andrew Powell, Royal College of Psychiatrists, Special Interest Group on Spirituality</i><br><br>"At first sight, this book seems just another description of how one can be overwhelmed by an emotional or psychological crisis and, in recognising it as a potentially life-changing spiritual experience, grow through it to emerge wiser and richer. This remarkable book, however, is the work of an author who affords readers glimpses of her own deep wounds, and shows how she navigated through her crisis by seeking and using insights derived from branches of modern psychology and ancient mystical wisdom. She also refers to others&#x2019; journeys through, what she terms, their 'spiritual emergency'.", <i>Revd Jenny Francis, psychotherapist, Church Times</i><br><br>"If you give the book to someone who is lost in a &#x2018;dark night&#x2019; and looking for reference points this read could make the difference between that person being 'mentally ill' or completing the most significant journey of life, the hero&#x2019;s journey.", <i>Emma Bragdon, PhD (psychology)</i><br><br>"The strength of this book lies in the willingness of its author to share her own experiences as well as draw on those of others to give the reader a real taste of what spiritual emergency is--in all its many wonders and occasional horrors.", <i>William West, Therapy Today Journal</i><br><br>"I have found this book extremely helpful in my practice.

She lives in Annapolis, Maryland.<p></p><p>~1~</p><p>The funeral was on a warm October day with a high blue sky and a single wispy white cloud that drifted, waiting like an angel, Kate thought. Her mother said they had been to Arlington National Cemetery before, when Kate&#x2019;s grandfather was buried, but that was ten years ago, when Kate was only two, and she didn&#x2019;t remember. Standing outside her grandmother&#x2019;s car, Kate brought her hopeful gaze down from the sky and took in the cemetery around them, gathering a little bit more strength from the beauty of the majestic trees that had turned the yellows and reds of autumn and shaded the endless rows of identical white tombstones.</p><p>Her grandmother had suggested that Kate and her five-year-old sister, Kerry, wear simple summer dresses because it was so warm, and carry a sweater in case it got cold later. So Kate had chosen a favorite blue jersey with tiny white dots and wore the ladybug earrings her father had bought for her a year ago at the county fair. She reached up to touch an earlobe while her mother and grandmother finished collecting things from the car. It was a bittersweet memory, that fair, because it was the last time Kate could remember her father going anywhere fun.</p><p>After the car was locked, Kate and her family set out across the parking lot to a special building. Kate was surprised to see so many people. Tourists, she guessed, judging by their cameras and the casual way they were dressed in shorts, jeans, and T-shirts, their outfits topped off by baseball caps and sun visors. Could they tell that Kate and her family were different? That they were here to actually bury someone? Kate desperately hoped these people wouldn&#x2019;t be allowed at the funeral. It didn&#x2019;t seem right and only added to the anxiety she already felt.</p><p>After a short walk to the administration building, they were directed to a special room, which, thankfully, was just for them. Although Kate knew her older brother, J.T., couldn&#x2019;t be there, because Mom had forbidden it, her eyes nevertheless swept the room, just to be sure. When she spied Uncle Ray and Aunt Helen standing nearby, talking with familiar neighbors, Kate took in and let out a deep breath. Then suddenly, her best friend, Jess, was there, opening her arms.</p><p>Kate embraced her. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know you were coming,&#x201d; she murmured into the mass of Jess&#x2019;s red curls. She and Jess had been best friends since first grade, when they met at a homeschoolers&#x2019; field trip to the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History. They were the only two brave enough to hold a giant hissing cockroach in their hands that day.</p><p>&#x201c;Of course we came,&#x201d; Jess said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re all going to miss your dad.&#x201d;</p><p> When the two girls released each other, Jess asked, &#x201c;Are you doing okay?&#x201d;</p><p>Kate slowly lifted her shoulders in a shrug, but thought, <i>Not really</i>.</p><p>Jess leaned in close. &#x201c;I saw Brady Parks last night.&#x201d;</p><p>Kate&#x2019;s eyebrows went up. &#x201c;You did?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I ran into him at the 7-Eleven.&#x201d;</p><p>Kate felt her heart squeezed yet again. It had been weeks since Kate had seen Brady. She had known him all her life. He lived next door, after all. He was a year older than Kate and best friends with her brother. Who knew when it happened, but at some point, probably sixth grade, a year after she entered public school, she had secretly developed a crush on Brady. No one but Jess ever suspected.</p><p>&#x201c;Brady said to tell you he was really sorry to hear about your dad,&#x201d; Jess told her. &#x201c;He said that he and his parents would have come to the funeral, but they were afraid it might not go over so well.&#x201d;</p><p>Kate&#x2019;s eyes widened even further, but she understood. It was Brady who had reported Kate&#x2019;s brother and another friend to the police after a prank ended tragically with the death of a little boy. For weeks afterward&#x2014;up until the day J.T. was sent to a juvenile detention center&#x2014;the boys didn&#x2019;t see each other, and didn&#x2019;t text or talk. Kate always figured they wouldn&#x2019;t want anything to do with each other ever again. And she just assumed that included her as well.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you sure?&#x201d; Kate asked. &#x201c;Brady said that?&#x201d;</p><p>Jess nodded, but there wasn&#x2019;t time to discuss it any further, or think about it just then, because an army officer was directing them on to the ceremony.</p><p>Back outside, a slight breeze stirred the sultry air. Kate glanced downhill, across the Potomac River at the city of Washington, DC, where she was surprised to see in a straight line, the Lincoln Memorial, the Washington Monument, and the Capitol. It made Kate proud that her father had fought in the Gulf War, and another wave of sadness rolled over her.</p><p>People attending her father&#x2019;s funeral got back in their cars and drove in a small caravan to a different location. Kate hadn&#x2019;t realized the cemetery was so big, although she knew from her grandmother that several funerals were taking place the same day, as many as twenty. Some were even happening at the same time, in different parts of the cemetery. The Tylers had had to wait three weeks for a burial date, and it had given Kate nightmares, the thought of her father on hold in &#x201c;cold storage,&#x201d; awaiting his turn to be buried. But in the end, the delay had given them some extra time, which turned out to be a good thing.</p><p>Kate later wrote in her journal.</p><p><i>We parked again. I told Kerry she had to leave her Barbie in the car. Then we walked the rest of the way. Grandma and Uncle Ray stayed with Mom. Sometimes it looked like they were holding her up. Kerry held tight to my hand. Everyone followed the four black horses that pulled a caisson with Dad&#x2019;s casket on it. It was sunny and getting hotter. I wished I had my sunglasses. The horses&#x2019; hooves clip-clopped on the hard asphalt of the narrow hilly road. Once we had to step around a fresh, steaming pile of horse manure.</i></p><p><i>When we arrived at the gravesite, a small military band was already there. An open-sided tent provided shade for two rows of chairs that were covered with the same color blue velvet as the inside of J.T.&#x2019;s trumpet case. Probably just a coincidence, but I did wonder if it was a sign.</i></p><p><i>The chaplain talked about Dad. He said Jacob Tyler was an honest, hardworking man who loved his wife, Angela, and his children, J.T., Kate, and Kerry. When Kerry heard her name, she leaned against my side and we squeezed hands again. It made me feel good that J.T. got mentioned. My brother practically ran the farm after Dad got so sick he couldn&#x2019;t work. But I worried all over again about what was going to happen to the family business and to us now that our father was gone.</i></p><p><i>When the chaplain talked about how much my father loved the Chesapeake Bay, where he&#x2019;d grown up and lived most all his life, I saw Uncle Ray cover his eyes. The chaplain didn&#x2019;t talk about this, but I remembered how Dad and Uncle Ray, who was a waterman, liked to go fishing every so often before dawn and how sometimes Dad would bring home a huge rockfish with glistening scales that filled the entire kitchen sink. How come we didn&#x2019;t take Dad out on the bay one last time so he could feel the breezes he loved so much? We knew he didn&#x2019;t have long to live. We could have bundled him up in quilts and taken him out on Uncle Ray&#x2019;s workboat.</i></p><p>Kate&#x2019;s journal description of the funeral ended there because after the chaplain finished and led them in prayer, the ceremony had shifted gears and Kate didn&#x2019;t want to write about the rest. She didn&#x2019;t want there to be a written record of what she had done.</p><p>&#x201c;Present arms!&#x201d; an officer barked in a loud, crisp voice. Everyone stood. Seven soldiers who were lined up on the hill before them raised their rifles angled toward the sky.</p><p>&#x201c;Prepare to fire!&#x201d; the voice called out. Kerry, who had folded her hands for the prayer, reached out for Kate&#x2019;s fingers.</p><p>&#x201c;Ready&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. aim&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. fire!&#x201d;</p><p>Seven rifles fired at the same time, cracking open the sky. Kerry jumped, grabbing Kate&#x2019;s hand with both of hers, and startled birds scattered, their wings beating the air. Three times, the order rang out. Three times, the soldiers fired simultaneously, their volleys honoring her father&#x2019;s military service.</p><p>When the guns fell silent, Kerry&#x2019;s grip let up, but Kate held her breath with anticipation because she knew that, in a moment, a bugle&#x2014;or a trumpet&#x2014;would sound taps.</p><p>Her mouth went dry as she counted to herself: One&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. two&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. three&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p><i>Day is done&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</i></p><p>The poignant and familiar opening notes rang out somberly.</p><p><i>Gone the sun&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</i></p><p>People shifted uncomfortably. Uncle Ray put an arm around the shoulders of Kate&#x2019;s mother. A lump formed in Kate&#x2019;s throat while she tried to figure out where the trumpeter stood.</p><p><i>From the hills&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</i></p><p>Somewhere behind them.</p><p><i>From the lake&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</i></p><p>All those years of Brownie Girl Scouts. Kate couldn&#x2019;t help but hear the words in her head as taps was played.</p><p><i>From the skies&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</i></p><p>Neither could she help but turn her head to look. He was hard to see, but through misty eyes, Kate discerned her brother&#x2019;s tall, lean profile on the crest of a small hill about fifty yards behind them. He wore black pants and a dark jacket, and Kate could tell that his hair had been cut really short. The silver instrument in his hand glinted in the late-afternoon sun. Miss Laurie, his counselor at the juvenile detention center, must have made time in his schedule for him to practice. Good for J.T., Kate thought, sighing with relief. A subtle, secret smile slowly graced her lips.</p><p><i>All is well&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</i></p><p>On the song&#x2019;s highest note, Kate slowly faced forward again. She didn&#x2019;t think anyone else had looked back, the way she had. So no one else in her family would ever know.</p><p><i>Safely rest&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</i></p><p>A tear slid down her cheek.</p><p><i>God is nigh&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</i></p><p>As the trumpet&#x2019;s last note lingered in the still air, Kate held her breath against a wall of overwhelming sadness but took comfort in knowing that not only had she honored her father&#x2019;s dying wish, she had protected her brother as well.</p><p>Miss Laurie, I&#x2019;m calling for my mother again.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. She wants you to handle it this way because J.T. being there, it might upset some people.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>The lie had been so easy.</p><p>A small lie, yes, but so what if you did it for your family?</p><p>After taps, two soldiers lifted the American flag that covered her father&#x2019;s coffin and straightened it with a dramatic snap before folding it, over and over, into a neat triangle. Like a reflection in a mirror, the two soldiers wore identical crisp blue uniforms. Their eyes connected as if by rods, their faces stern and expressionless as the folding flag drew them together, step by step. The flag was presented to Kate&#x2019;s mother by the chaplain on bended knee. &#x201c;On behalf of the president of the United States&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a grateful nation.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>When Kate turned to look again, the crest of the hill was empty. J.T. was gone, having quietly, and quickly, disappeared. As they had discussed.</p><p>Kate had done what she had to do, and no one else knew. No one else would ever need to know.</p><p>Only later did Kate look back on her father&#x2019;s funeral and wonder if that kind of thinking was where her own downfall began.</p><p></p><p></p><p>~2~</p><p>What happens next?&#x201d; Kerry asked, tugging on the skirt of Kate&#x2019;s dress.</p><p>&#x201c;I think it&#x2019;s over,&#x201d; Kate told her. &#x201c;We walk back to our cars.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Are we going home, then?&#x201d; She pouted. &#x201c;I want my kitty. I want Jingles.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know, Kerry,&#x201d; Kate said, distracted. She glanced at the hill behind them to see if it was still empty. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure if we go straight home or not.&#x201d;</p><p>Suddenly, a commotion up ahead had people scrambling.</p><p>Kate glimpsed her mother, crumpled on the ground, with Uncle Ray bending over her. Pulling Kerry along, Kate began to run toward them.</p><p>Aunt Helen stopped her. &#x201c;Kate, let me take Kerry,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&#x201c;No!&#x201d; Kerry whimpered. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m scared. What&#x2019;s wrong with Mommy?&#x201d; But Kate released her sister into Aunt Helen&#x2019;s arms and rushed on.</p><p>Was it a heart attack? Kate&#x2019;s own heart pounded high in her chest. Her mother&#x2019;s hand was up at her throat, like she was struggling to breathe. Was she going to die the same day they buried her father? Kate&#x2019;s hand covered her mouth. Could something like that really happen to people?</p><p>Uncle Ray stood up. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay,&#x201d; he told the chaplain, who was pulling out a cell phone. Her uncle&#x2019;s voice was surprisingly calm. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t need to call for help. It&#x2019;s a panic attack. She&#x2019;s had them before.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s right,&#x201d; said Kate&#x2019;s grandmother, who was kneeling on the ground beside Kate&#x2019;s mother. She looked up at the two men. &#x201c;She needs to focus on her breathing. Give us some space. <i>Please</i>.&#x201d;</p><p>The chaplain turned to the gathering crowd and held up his arms. &#x201c;She needs space! Some privacy, please!&#x201d;</p><p>People stopped and, haltingly, moved away. Kate brought her hand down, but stayed kneeling beside her grandmother.</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;ll be all right, hon,&#x201d; Grandma said, tapping Kate&#x2019;s knee before leaning over Kate&#x2019;s mother. &#x201c;Angela, a deep breath. That&#x2019;s it! In on five. Now hold for two.&#x201d;</p><p>This was all new to Kate. A panic attack? Breathing and counting? Kate had thought she knew her mother&#x2019;s secrets. But apparently not.</p><p>*</p><p>It took Grandma two hours to drive from the cemetery to the Tylers&#x2019; home on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. By the time they arrived, it was late afternoon, and Kate&#x2019;s exhausted mother went straight to bed. The two girls changed into jeans, while Kate&#x2019;s grandmother fixed them grilled cheese sandwiches for dinner. Kerry was allowed to keep the cat on her lap while they ate, and no one spoke much. Even Tucker, J.T.&#x2019;s border collie, seemed to pick up on the mood and lay quietly beneath the kitchen table, surrounded by their feet.</p><p>A low rumble and the grating sound of a large truck shifting gears distracted them. Kate pushed back her chair and, flip-flops flapping, went to the living room picture window that faced the road. &#x201c;Darn!&#x201d; she muttered, disappointed to see a gray-colored school bus crunching over the long oyster-shell driveway.</p><p>&#x201c;What is it?&#x201d; Grandma asked when Kate returned to the kitchen.</p><p>&#x201c;The new chicks are here,&#x201d; Kate told her.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, dear,&#x201d; her grandmother sympathized. &#x201c;They wouldn&#x2019;t even give you the day off for your father&#x2019;s funeral.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s fine, Grandma. No big deal,&#x201d; Kate said, quickly putting her best face on it. &#x201c;We knew they were coming; I just forgot. Uncle Ray already asked me to do it. He had to get home for that plumber, remember? Something happened to their well.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, bless your heart,&#x201d; Grandma said, reaching for a napkin. &#x201c;Here, take the sandwich with you.&#x201d;</p><p>Kate waved her off. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay,&#x201d; she said, sitting on the floor to pull on old sneakers. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d rather eat when it&#x2019;s done.&#x201d;</p><p>When she was ready, Tucker scrambled through the back door before Kate and rushed across the yard, barking at the bus-turned-delivery truck as it beeped and backed up to a long, low building.

Greeley outdoes his previous triumphs with<i> Irish Gold</i>, a contemporary, fresh and exciting novel of suspense and love. Nuala Anne McGrail, a student at Dublin's Trinity College, is beautiful the way a Celtic goddess is beautiful - not that Dermot Michael Coyne of Chicago has ever seen one of those in his twenty-five years - unless you count his grandmother Nell, who left Ireland during the Troubles with her husband Liam O'Riada, and who would never tell why they left. Somebody else remembers, though - or why is Dermot set upon by thugs?</p></p><p><p>Priest, sociologist, author and journalist, <b>Father Andrew M. Greeley</b> built an international assemblage of devout fans over a career spanning five decades. His books include the Bishop Blackie Ryan novels, including <i>The Archbishop in Andalusia</i>, the Nuala Anne McGrail novels, including <i>Irish Tweed</i>, and <i>The Cardinal Virtues</i>. He was the author of over 50 best-selling novels and more than 100 works of non-fiction, and his writing has been translated into 12 languages.</p><p>Father Greeley was a Professor of Sociology at the University of Arizona and a Research Associate with the National Opinion Research Center (NORC) at the University of Chicago. In addition to scholarly studies and popular fiction, for many years he penned a weekly column appearing in the <i>Chicago Sun-Times</i> and other newspapers. He was also a frequent contributor to <i>The New York Times</i>, the <i>National Catholic Reporter</i>, <i>America </i>and <i>Commonweal</i>, and was interviewed regularly on national radio and television. He authored hundreds of articles on sociological topics, ranging from school desegregation to elder sex to politics and the environment.</p><p>Throughout his priesthood, Father Greeley unflinchingly urged his beloved Church to become more responsive to evolving concerns of Catholics everywhere. His clear writing style, consistent themes and celebrity stature made him a leading spokesperson for generations of Catholics. He chronicled his service to the Church in two autobiographies, <i>Confessions of a Parish Priest</i> and <i>Furthermore!</i></p><p>In 1986, Father Greeley established a $1 million Catholic Inner-City School Fund, providing scholarships and financial support to schools in the Chicago Archdiocese with a minority student body of more than 50 percent. In 1984, he contributed a $1 million endowment to establish a chair in Roman Catholic Studies at the University of Chicago. He also funded an annual lecture series, "The Church in Society," at St. Mary of the Lake Seminary, Mundelein, Illinois, from which he received his S.T.L. in 1954.</p><p>Father Greeley received many honors and awards, including honorary degrees from the National University of Ireland at Galway, the University of Arizona and Bard College. A Chicago native, he earned his M.A. in 1961 and his Ph.D. in 1962 from the University of Chicago.</p><p>Father Greeley was a penetrating student of popular culture, deeply engaged with the world around him, and a lifelong Chicago sports fan, cheering for the Bulls, Bears and the Cubs. Born in 1928, he died in May 2013 at the age of 85.</p><p>&#x2013;&#x2013; 1 &#x2013;&#x2013;<br>&#x201c;THE IRISH,&#x201d; I insisted to the black-haired young woman whose face might have belonged to a pre-Christian Celtic goddess, &#x201c;are different. They look like some of the rest of us and they speak a language that&#x2019;s remotely like ours. Many of them even have the same names as we do. But they&#x2019;re different&#x2014;almost like aliens from another planet.&#x201d;<br>I&#x2019;ve never met a pre-Christian Celtic goddess, but the girl looked like the images I formed in my head when I read the ancient sagas.<br>&#x201c;Pissantgobshite.&#x201d; She peered at me over her dark glass of Guinness, mildly offended but intrigued.<br>Not very goddesslike language, huh?<br>I had sworn off women, for excellent reasons I thought. But, as my brother George the priest had insisted, the hormones tend to be irresistible.<br>&#x201c;Womanly charms,&#x201d; George had observed, &#x201c;are not of enormous moment compared to intelligence and personality. However, especially for the tumescent young male, they must be reckoned as not completely trivial.&#x201d;<br>That&#x2019;s the way George talks.<br>I avoided the distraction of telling my Irish goddess that the words of her scatological response ran together like a phrase in the writings of her man Jimmy Joyce. I was homesick, baffled, and a little frightened. My body ached in a hundred places from the brawl on Baggot Street the day before. I was worried that Pa, my beloved grandfather, might have been a terrorist and a murderer when he was a young man. I wanted some sympathy.<br>Womanly sympathy.<br>Young womanly sympathy.<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s an example of what I mean.&#x201d; I leaned forward so she could hear me over the noise of the student-filled pub&#x2014;O&#x2019;Neill&#x2019;s, on Suffolk Street across from St. Andrew&#x2019;s Church (C. of I., which means Anglican). &#x201c;What did you say your name is?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t.&#x201d; She frowned, a warning signal that I had interrupted her pursuit of world economics and that, if I didn&#x2019;t mind me manners, she would stalk away from the table.<br>&#x201c;Mine&#x2019;s Dermot,&#x201d; I said brightly. &#x201c;Dermot Coyne, Dermot Michael Coyne&#x2014;son of the dark stranger, as you probably know.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Fockingrichyank.&#x201d;<br>The child&#x2014;she was twenty at the most&#x2014;was strikingly beautiful. At least her cream-white face and breast-length black hair promised great beauty. The rest of her was encased in a gray sweatshirt with &#x201c;Dublin Millennium&#x201d; in dark blue letters, jeans, and a dark blue cloth jacket with a hood&#x2014;not goddess clothes, exactly. Her face, slender and fine-boned, was the sort that stares at you from the covers of women&#x2019;s magazines&#x2014;except that the cover women don&#x2019;t usually have a haunting hint in their deep blue eyes of bogs and druids and old Irish poetry. The bottom half of her face was a sweeping, elegant curve which almost demanded that male fingers caress it with reassurance and affection. However, the center of the curve was a solid chin that warned trespassing, or potentially trespassing, male fingers that they had better not offend this young woman or they would be in deep trouble.<br>I&#x2019;m a romantic, you say?<br>Why else would I loiter in O&#x2019;Neill&#x2019;s pub around the corner from Trinity College with nothing to do except look for beautiful faces, the kind whose image will cling to your memory for the rest of your life?<br>The mists swirling outside the darkened pub, which smelled like Guinness&#x2019;s brewery on a humid day, seemed to have slipped inside and soaked the walls and floors and tables and the coats of the noisy young people with permanent moisture. My friend across the table was an oasis of light and warmth in a desert of wet and gloomy darkness. Blue-eyed, druid maiden light.<br>All right, I&#x2019;m a terrible romantic. I&#x2019;m worse than that, as you will see when I have finished telling my story. I&#x2019;m a dumb romantic.<br>&#x201c;That established my point.&#x201d; I continued the argument, unable to look away from her suspicious but radiant blue eyes. &#x201c;Do you speak Irish?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Better than you speak English,&#x201d; she snapped. &#x201c;And I&#x2019;m trying to study&#x201d;&#x2014;she gestured with a slim elegant hand&#x2014;&#x201c;for my focking world economics quiz, which is why no one is sitting with me at this table.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Ah, but someone is indeed: one Dermot Coyne. Now tell me, nameless one&#x201d;&#x2014;I smiled my most charming dimpled smile&#x2014;&#x201c;what obscene and scatological words exist in your language?&#x201d;<br>She tilted her head back and her chin up, ready for a fight. &#x201c; &#x2019;Tis a pure and gentle language.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Ah, &#x2019;tis all of that.&#x201d; I leaned closer so that her inviting lips were only a foot from mine&#x2014;and felt the pain in my ribs from last night&#x2019;s brawl. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m surprised that you didn&#x2019;t say it was a focking pure language.&#x201d;<br>Did I detect a hint of a smile? What would she look like if she took off her jacket?<br>As George would say, a not completely trivial issue.<br>&#x201c;Now,&#x201d; I continued reasonably, &#x201c;let me tell you about an event I observed when I was doing research on this alien race that claims some relation to my own harmless Irish-American people. In pursuit of this project I am attending a cultural exercise in an artistic center with which, O lovely nameless one, I am sure you are familiar&#x2014;Croke Park.&#x201d;<br>The ends of her lips turned up a little more. I was a big Yank, probably rich like all Yanks, probably preparing to make a pass like all rich Yank males, but I was also ever so faintly amusing. My heart, which ought to have known better after my earlier failures in love, picked up its beat.<br>I must add for the record that I was not preparing to make a pass. I had enough troubles in life as it was without becoming involved with a woman. All I wanted at that point was a little maternal sympathy because of my recent and unfortunate encounters with the Special Branch, a euphemism for the local secret police. Nonetheless, at twenty-five an unattached male of our species will inevitably evaluate a young woman of the same species as a potential bed partner and perhaps even as a remote possibility for a mate&#x2014;even if my mother is convinced that I am destined to be a typical Irish bachelor. Such an evaluation will be all the more intense if the young woman across the table from him in a smoke-filled Dublin pub possesses the most beautiful face he has ever seen, a face all the more wonderful because of its total innocence of makeup.<br>&#x201c;Maybe you&#x2019;ll find a sweet little girl in Ireland and bring her home,&#x201d; Mom had said brightly during our last phone conversation.<br>&#x201c;Like your mother?&#x201d;<br>Mom laughed. &#x201c;Well, she was little anyway.&#x201d;<br>I was beginning to fall in love, you say? Ah, friend, I begin to fall in love almost every day and, having been badly burned twice, rarely get beyond the beginning. When I begin to fall in love, the issue is infatuation and flirtation, not the kind of love out of which permanent union might be fashioned. I&#x2019;d known that kind of love too, and I didn&#x2019;t want any of it now, thank you very much.<br>This lass from the bogs was more appealing than most of the women who stir my heart, you say? And I had actually talked to her, which is a rare event when I begin to fall in love?<br>Too true.<br>The nameless one had already forced me to reevaluate my contention that all the beautiful female genes had migrated to America.<br>&#x201c;You went to the All Ireland match at Croke Park, did you?&#x201d; She tapped her notebook impatiently with a Bic pen. I didn&#x2019;t have much time to tell my story or her royal majesty would dismiss me to the nether regions of her empire.<br>Most Irish conversational dialogue, I had discovered, ends in question marks. I tried to adjust to the custom, with only modest success.<br>I will not try to write English the way the Irish speak it in this story. For that I strongly recommend the books of Roddy Doyle. Thus when you see the letters &#x201c;th,&#x201d; you must realize that their language has (sometimes) no sound to correspond to those consonants. Moreover, the vowel &#x201c;u&#x201d; is often pronounced as if it were &#x201c;oo,&#x201d; as in &#x201c;Dooblin.&#x201d; For example, if the Gaelic womanly deity to whom I was talking should say &#x201c;The only thing to do is to tell the truth when you&#x2019;re thinking about it,&#x201d; you must imagine her as sounding as if she said, &#x201c;De only ting to do is tell da troot when you&#x2019;re tinking about it.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t I now?&#x201d; I continued my tale of Croke Park. &#x201c;And didn&#x2019;t Cork beat Mayo? And wasn&#x2019;t I sitting next to a nice old Mayo lady who prayed her rosary beads before the game, uh, match began? And didn&#x2019;t she put away her beads and shout encouragement to the players? I now recite a typical expression which I had the foresight to jot down in my notebook.&#x201d; I removed a spiral pad from my Savile Row jacket pocket. &#x201c;Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, Slattery, for the love of God, will you get the load of shit out of your focking pants and kick the focking ball into the focking net, instead of standing there like a pissant amadon!&#x201d;<br>I snapped the notebook shut, my case having been made. The nameless one laughed, a rich, generous, and devastating laugh. She probably had no idea how beautiful she was or that she was even beautiful&#x2014;an innocent child from the bogs.<br>Time would prove that the first part of my estimate was accurate enough. The second remains even now problematic.<br>&#x201c;At least for an alien race,&#x201d; she conceded, &#x201c;aren&#x2019;t we colorful now?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;About that, lovely nameless one, you will get no argument from me.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;A song, Nuala,&#x201d; some large oaf with a thick Cork accent demanded. &#x201c; &#x2019;Tis time for one of your songs!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t you see I&#x2019;m stud...</p></p><h2>A Change of Light and Other Stories</h2><p>The masterful Argentinian writer includes nineteen stories penned during the last seven years, tales about a couple&#39;s adventurous vacation in Africa, a disturbed man&#39;s erotic subway games, and other intriguing activities and situations</p><p>Text: English, Spanish (translation)</p><h2>The Heritage of Chinese Cooking (Heritage Cookbook)</h2><p>The founder of Australia&#39;s premier Chinese cooking school provides a full-color cook&#39;s tour through fifty centuries of Chinese cuisine, complete with distinctive regional recipes. 15,000 first printing.</p><p></p><h2>Families</h2><p>Explores the roots, meanings, and present realities of the family particularly in America, examining the processes by which families develop their own identities, the forms that families take, and the extent to which our lives are intertwined with those of our family members</p><p><p> <em>Jane Howard</em> is the author of <i>A Different Woman, Please Touch: A Guided Tour of the Human Potential Movement, and Margaret Mead: A Life. </i></p></p><h2>The Year&#39;s Best Science Fiction: Nineteenth Annual Collection</h2><p>The twenty-first century has so far proven to be exciting and wondrous and filled with challenges we had never dreamed.

Alfred Corn's novel <i>Part of His Story</i> details the bereavement of a writer who, after his lover has died, moves to London ostensibly to research a new book, but in actuality to come to terms with the past. Corn, a prize-winning poet, writes with a sedate beauty that allows his character's emotions and inner lives to unfold with dignity and intelligence. While <i>Part of His Story</i> revolves around a complicated plot--the narrator finds a new lover connected to the struggle for Irish independence--the novel is, in essence, a meditation on loss and rebirth in the midst of death and violence.An elegy to love lost and found in which poet Corn (Incarnation: Contemporary Writers on the New Testament, 1990) tests the waters of fiction for the first time. Avery Walsh, like all expatriates, is on the lam. A successful New York playwright, Avery is in Britain just now, taking his time over a biography he's been commissioned to write of the 18th- century London playwright Colley Cibber. Not anyone's idea of a workaholic, Avery manages to keep his heart in his work because it's dangerous to do otherwise: His lover Joshua has recently died of AIDS, and there's little joy in thinking of their lives together, though that is what he mostly does. ``Certainly,'' he asserts, ``I don't plan to come off as broken down with bereavement and sorrow (but I am, I am!).'' So he plods through his days, making notes and checking references at the British Museum and dealing with a few select literary friends in Hampstead or Spitalfields to keep up on the local gossip and the word from home. Then he meets Maeve Findlater, a leftist activist from Ireland, while she is passing out anti-apartheid leaflets on the street. She introduces him to her brother Derek, a reformed junkie on the dole. Avery is quickly drawn into a kind of emotional alliance with the two, a bond of desperation mixed with anger that awakens many of the feelings he's tried to suppress--especially when he and Derek find themselves falling in love. The fear of loss that Avery carries within him, though, suddenly becomes cruelly literal when Maeve and Derek become embroiled in violence during a mysterious trip to Ireland. In the end, Avery has to return to the life that he's left behind and discovers that he can, in fact, go home again. A work so beautifully constructed that one wants to overlook its rambling narrative, hackneyed plot, and two-dimensional people. Impressive in parts, but finally unpersuasive. -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

China and the United States are heading toward a war neither wants. The reason, argues Harvard scholar Graham Allison in this razor-sharp analysis, is Thucydides&#39;s Trap. This phenomenon, as old as history itself, is named for the Greek historian&#39;s assessment of why the Peloponnesian War broke out: a rising power threatened to displace a ruling one. Over the past 500 years, such a struggle has occurred between major powers just sixteen times. In twelve cases, it resulted in war. Today, as an unstoppable China approaches an immovable America, and both Xi Jinping and Donald Trump promise to make their countries `great again&#39;, the seventeenth case looks grim. Unless China scales back its ambitions or the US accepts becoming number two in the Pacific, a trade conflict, cyber attack, or accident at sea could soon escalate. Through uncanny historical parallels, Destined for War shows how close we are to the unthinkable. Yet, stressing that war is not inevitable, Allison also reveals how clashing powers have kept the peace in the past - and what painful steps the US and China can and must take to avoid disaster.</p><p>`As a single volume on the shape of the gathering rivalry and co-operation between the United States and China, this book is to be highly recommended. It is clearly written with a popular audience in mind. As such it can join the ranks of a number of such books that explain a wide range of complex concepts and historical episodes in a way that the layperson can readily engage with.' * NZ International Review * `Thought-provoking and very readable.' * The Sunday Times * `Surely another classic in the making, Destined for War is a brilliant example of `thinking in time,' which - as the author shows - is against us.' -- Brendan Simms * author of <i>Europe: The Struggle for Supremacy</i> * `Graham Allison has been a source of inspiration for me as a student and diplomat. As with Essence of Decision, Destined for War again provides us with his penetrating insights into global politics in the 21st century and beyond.' -- Ban Ki-Moon * former Secretary General of the United Nations * `If any book can stop a world war, it is this one. This gripping book is a must read for policy makers in both nations as well as the general public.' -- Sam Nunn `Reading Destined for War and drawing from its lessons could help to save the lives of millions of people.' -- Klaus Schwab `Destined for War is a must-read for anyone concerned about US-China relations. A gifted combination of scholarship with truly accessible writing.' -- Amitai Etzioni `Essential, even indispensable reading for every diplomat-and financier or businessman - that contemplates China and its relations with the world.' -- Kurt Campbell `Graham Allison is the Paul Revere of the nuclear age. In his brilliant book, Allison provides us with a heart stopping look into a future that may end as abruptly as the past began.' -- William Cohen `Graham Allison has written the most important foreign policy book of our time.' -- Sandy Winnefeld `For policymakers, scholars, and citizens on both sides of the Pacific Ocean, Destined for War is essential reading.' -- Ash Carter `Graham Allison has written a gripping book that decision-makers and citizens alike must read, digest, and act upon.' -- Samantha Power `An important new book.' * Financial Times * `Do China and America want war? No. Might they be compelled into conflict by severe structural stress? Yes. Thankfully, Allison charts an essential course to avoid a catastrophic collision. Destined for War will be studied and debated for decades.' -- Kevin Rudd * former Prime Minister of Australia * `A provocative thesis on one of today's most pressing foreign policy issues and a page turner of the first order, Destined For War is a must read. Professor Allison writes with the propulsive narrative drive appropriate for such an immediate and danger-fraught topic. I can only hope that all senior policy experts read this timely book to prevent our country from falling into the trap Professor Allison so ably warns us against.' -- Christopher Reich * bestselling author of <i>Invasion of Privacy</i> * `One of the most insightful and thought-provoking books I have ever read on the most important relationship in the world: the US and China. If Graham Allison is right-and I think he is-China and the US must heed the lessons in this superb study in order to build a strategic relationship that avoids a war which neither side would win.' -- General (Ret.) David Petraeus * Chairman of the KKR Global Institute, former Director of the CIA, and former Commander of US Central Command * `You can bet that China's leaders will read Allison's warnings about Thucydides's Trap. I only wish I could be as sure about America's leaders. But every informed citizen should buy a copy.' -- Niall Ferguson `Can the US avoid confrontation with China? That is the geopolitical question of our age. In most cases, Thucydides was right: when a new power arises in the world, it results in a clash with the dominant power. This important and fascinating book extracts lessons for how we can avoid such a confrontation.' -- Walter Isaacson * author of <i>Steve Jobs</i> and <i>The Innovators</i> * `Thucydides's Trap identifies a cardinal challenge to world order: the impact of a rising power on a ruling power. I read the book with great interest. I can only hope that the US-China relationship becomes the fifth case to resolve itself peacefully, rather than the 13th to result in war.' -- Henry Kissinger * former United States Secretary of State * `Graham Allison is one of the keenest observers of international affairs around. He consistently brings his deep understanding of history's currents to today's most difficult challenges and makes our toughest foreign policy dilemmas accessible to experts and everyday citizens alike. That's why I regularly sought his counsel both as a senator and as vice president. In Destined for War, Allison lays out one of the defining challenges of our time-managing the critical relationship between China and the United States.' -- Joe Biden * former Vice President of the United States * `I hope people like Jeff Bezos read this timely book and resolve to build the political forces we need.' -- Dominic Cummings * The Spectator * `[Destined for War] sounds a useful, even important warning call.' -- Max Hastings * The Sunday Times *</p><h2>Secret Formula: How Brilliant Marketing and Relentless Salesmanship Made Coca-Cola the Best-Known Product in the World</h2><p>A history of Coca-Cola traces the company from the debut of the popular soft drink in an Atlanta soda fountain to its present status as a multibillion-dollar international corporation, drawing on the personal papers of founder Asa Candler and long-time CEO Robert Woodruff.</p><p>Frederick Allen was an award-winning reporter and political columnist with the&nbsp;Atlanta Journal-Constitution&nbsp;from 1972 to&nbsp;1987,&nbsp;after which he joined CNN as&nbsp;a chief&nbsp;analyst and commentator covering the 1988 presidential election. His essays for the program&nbsp;Inside Politics earned CNN a CableACE Award, and Allen was called the &#x201c;best&nbsp;political analyst&#x201d; by the editors of the&nbsp;Hotline.An informative and agreeably anecdotal history of the Atlanta- based multinational that, despite the best efforts of archrival PepsiCo, continues to bestride the global soft-drink trade like a colossus. Drawing on a wealth of archival sources and personal interviews, CNN commentator Allen offers a generation-spanning account of how Coca-Cola Co. (which turned 100 in 1986) managed to achieve cultural significance as well as commercial success. While he covers much the same ground as Mark Pendergrast in For God, Country, and Coca-Cola (1993), Allen focuses to good effect on the individuals who have played leading roles in corporate affairs: founding father Asa Candler, a dour hustler who acquired the rights to Pemberton's Tonic, an obscure patent medicine that became the basis of a beverage empire; Robert Woodruff, a banker's son who did more than anyone to build the company's extraordinary consumer franchise; and Cuban-born Roberto Goizueta, the incumbent CEO who, notwithstanding a notable blunder with the flagship brand, has kept Coke on a fast upward track. As its subtitle suggests, Allen attributes Coca-Cola's accomplishments to dedication and merchandizing savvy, not to the exotic ingredients in a soft-drink recipe that's been altered a dozen or more times over the years. In this account, moreover, the company's stewards proved themselves alertly opportunistic during WW II, classically pragmatic when they became early backers of America's civil rights movement, astute students of political risk in any era or venue, and aggressive strategists in the ongoing cola wars. Allen effectively ends his coverage with Woodruff's death at 95 in 1985, touching only lightly on events of the past decade. An engaging audit of a corporate phenomenon that wisely eschews what-it-all-means analysis in favor of a vivid narrative that can speak for itself.

Although the Romans have already left Britain, Uther Pendragon is a Roman king, married to the Celtic princess Igraine, daughter of Merlin. Their son Arthur, conceived before Igraine's divorce from her first husband, has been raised in secret with Merlin's younger daughter Morgan, wherein lies the emotional heart of this tale. Arthur and Morgan, his half-aunt, share a love that cannot be acknowledged. When, as king, he must marry, Arthur weds the Celtic princess Gwenhwyfar, but he and Morgan remain lovers, while Gwenhwyfar, with Arthur's blessing, finds love with Bedwyr, the king's closest friend and ally. With the strength of his leadership and personality, Arthur unifies the British tribes, repells the Saxon threat and, adapting Roman ideas of government, establishes peace in the kingdom. But when Mordred, a young Celtic prince with an uncanny likeness to Arthur, comes to Camelot, jealousy and ambition threaten Arthur's dream. Portraying characters with crisp and memorable originality, Wolf capturesand enrichesthe tragic sweep of romance and idealism inherent in the Arthurian tale. Imaginative and moving, this narrative by the author of The Rebel and the Rose is historical fiction at its finest. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Child of the Holy Grail (Guenevere Novels)</h2><p>Guenevere ...<br>Last in a line of proud queens elected to rule the fertile lands of the West, true owner of the legendary Round Table, guardian of the Great Goddess herself . . . a woman whose story has never been told &#x2014; until now<br><br>Brokenhearted at her parting from Lancelot and anguished over the loss of the sacred Hallows of the Goddess, Queen Guenevere reconciles with Arthur, although the fragile bond between them is threatened by a new presence at Camelot. Prince Mordred, Arthur's son by Morgan Le Fay, has come to stay and to be proclaimed heir to Guenevere and Arthur's kingdoms. Arthur has even designated for his son the Siege Perilous, the one unoccupied seat at the Round Table &#x2014; the seat reserved for "the Son of the Most Peerless Knight in All the World."<br><br>But at the knighting, when Mordred takes his seat, the great Round Table, owned by the Queens of the Summer Country since time immemorial, cracks down the center. A terrible darkness falls over Camelot and in the midst of the chaos appears a new knight, Sir Galahad. Barely fourteen, he may hold the key to the mystery of the stolen Hallows, which the Christians believe to be the Holy Grail. The scene sets into motion the final brilliant cycle of the Arthurian legend-the Quest for the Grail and the fall of Camelot-which brings Guenevere to the brink of the most dreaded tragedy of all . . . and may ultimately complete her destiny as the greatest and most powerful Queen of the Isles.</p><p>Rosalind Miles is a well-known and critically acclaimed English novelist, essayist, and broadcaster.

But deep in the heart of the rock, it was warm and dry. Inside the high-domed underground dwelling-place, the light from many candles played over walls swagged in blood-red velvet, looped and tied back with ropes of silver-gilt. Bright rugs from the East covered the stony floor in amber and indigo, garnet, rose, and black. A low fire glowed and murmured on the hearth, its slender plume of smoke lost in the void above.<br>In the center of the chamber, Merlin lay on a curiously made couch, staring at the ceiling through tightly closed eyes. A wand of golden yew lay within reach, humming softly to itself in a high, beelike whine. His hands lay loosely at his sides, palms upward, fingers reaching, ready to catch his dreams as they came down. A ring of candles shone around his head. The flames quivered and changed color, and he knew the time was near.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, yes,&#x201d; he muttered tensely. &#x201c;I am ready&#x2013;come&#x2013;&#x201d;<br>Suddenly his thumbs began to itch. For a second his mind turned to milk, warding off the ancient sign of impending evil and danger ahead. He crushed his thumbs in his fists to drive it away. The itching intensified.<br><br>&#x201c;No!&#x201d; he moaned.<br><br>No, he was Merlin still; it could not be. Feverishly he composed himself again for waking sleep, the magic sleep of the Druids he had learned long ago, preparing to send his spirit from his body as he always did. Once he had made the long hard leap of faith, his spirit self would walk the astral plane, gathering the secrets of the Otherworld. When he had to return, when his roaming soul submitted to his body&#x2019;s chain, he would know how to deal with what was to come.<br><br>&#x201c;Come to me! Come!&#x201d;<br><br>Yesss&#x2013;<br><br>He could feel his soul straining at the leash, hungry for the void. Any moment now, yes, yesss&#x2013;<br><br>Merlin, Merlin, attend&#x2013;<br><br>A series of stabbing pains shot through his thumbs. Moaning, the old enchanter opened his eyes and forced himself to sit up. There was no avoiding it. There could be no flight of the spirit while this loomed. Evil impending? Where did the danger lie?<br><br>Throwing his skinny feet to the floor, he struggled upright and began to pace his cave dwelling, blind to the dark beauty of the place and the books and treasures he had brought there over the years. Mumbling and twitching, he came to rest at last before a silk curtain hanging on the wall. Behind it was an oddly shaped piece of glass in a deep frame. In its clouded depths, he saw a reflection stir and forced himself to interrogate the shadowy shape within.<br><br>&#x201c;Danger then?&#x201d; he ground out.<br><br>Danger, the answer came.<br><br>&#x201c;To Arthur?&#x201d;<br><br>Arthur.<br><br>Merlin gasped in fear. How could it be? He had left Arthur well and happy, not three moons ago. To be sure, Arthur was not as young as he was, and the old man detested the lines deepening on the face he loved, and the gray spreading through his former pupil&#x2019;s glistening fair hair. But for a knight in his forties, Arthur was in his prime. His massive frame was almost unscathed by tournaments and battles, his fine face had lost none of its warmth, and his gray eyes were as kindly as ever, and much wiser now.<br><br>Arthur&#x2013;<br><br>With another stab to the heart, Merlin remembered the boy Arthur once had been. Never had a fairer youth trodden the earth, except for Uther Pendragon, Arthur&#x2019;s father, Merlin&#x2019;s kinsman and dear liege lord. Merlin paused, ambushed by bitter memories again. Well, Uther had long gone down to the Underworld. Gone, all gone, all the Pendragon kings. No grieving or pining would call them back now.<br><br>But Arthur&#x2013;<br><br>Merlin turned back to the shadow in the mirror and tore his long <br>gray locks.<br><br>&#x201c;How can Arthur be in distress?&#x201d; he wailed. &#x201c;He has what his heart desired! I found him the child!&#x201d;<br><br>The child? quibbled the image in the glass.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, yes, child no longer, I know,&#x201d; Merlin retorted feverishly. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s a grown man. But how can the danger lie there? Arthur loves the boy! Why, Mordred is everything to him now&#x2013;&#x201d;<br><br>But still the smoky shape wavered in the glass. The child, the child, the child&#x2013;<br><br>&#x201c;Gods above!&#x201d; Merlin struck his head. Twenty years had passed since the boy Mordred could be called a child. If he was not the child, then it must mean another child to come.<br><br>A child of Guenevere&#x2019;s?<br><br>Merlin tore himself from the mirror and flung himself down on his couch. The Queen had indeed been childless for many years. But she was still within her childbearing years. Many a woman in her forties still gave birth, let alone one like Guenevere, tall and well formed, blessed in life and love. Could the child his spirit was warning him of be hers?<br>Gods above! Around his head the candles danced blue and yellow, mocking his distress. Guenevere, yes, he might have known!<br>Guenevere!<br><br>The old enchanter gave full rein to his spleen. If only Arthur had taken another bride! He could have married a princess of the Christians, a sweet silent thing, tame as a caged bird to his ruling hand. But instead he chose a queen with her own kingdom, one born into the way of women&#x2019;s rule. Time and again, Guenevere had taken Arthur by surprise. And this would not be the last.<br><br>&#x201c;How long, ye gods, how long?&#x201d; Merlin wailed, beating his breast. When would he be free of his eternal task of saving the house of Pendragon, keeping it alive till its name was fixed forever in the stars? He had found the lost son, and had given Arthur an heir. Another child now would lead to confusion, and worse. A boy would encourage rebellion and bring rogue lords and disaffected kings to challenge Mordred as the rightful heir.<br><br>And a girl&#x2013;<br><br>Worse, much worse. Merlin clasped his head. The Summer Country followed the rule of queens. Guenevere was the last in a line going back to the Great One Herself, the Goddess who had mothered the whole world. To those of the old faith, a girl child would inherit the Mother-right, she would be born to take command. Guenevere&#x2019;s daughter could prevail over Arthur&#x2019;s son. And Pendragon then would be swept away, no more than a blink in the long eye of time.<br><br>&#x201c;No!&#x201d;<br><br>Merlin scrambled round his cave, cursing and weeping his fill. All his life, all his many lives, he had fought for Pendragon, only to see his great work threatened every time. Now he must leave his warm, secure refuge and take to the road. He must close up the hidden door in the hillside with strong spells so that no one would disturb his mountain lair. The harsh winds would scour his unprotected flanks and make a tangled mat of his long hair, the iron-gray locks that he groomed and perfumed each day with such care. The wild rain would be his only clothing now, the cold highway his lonely habitation, as he lived at one with the hare and the midnight owl, and no man could tell when he would be home again.<br><br>But it would all be for Arthur.<br><br>And for Arthur&#x2019;s child.<br><br>The child.<br><br>A spark of hope flared in the old man&#x2019;s wizened heart. Guenevere might bear a child such as Arthur had once been, sturdy and well made, with hair of bright gold and eyes of heartbreaking truth. And perhaps he, old Merlin, might get the child for himself, wrest it from Guenevere as he had taken Arthur from the arms of his mother, Igraine. Then the future of Pendragon would be secure. And he, Merlin, would have the rearing of a new High King&#x2013;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes!&#x201d;<br><br>The old man leaped to his feet in ecstasy. Throwing back his head, he emitted a soundless hail. The white mule grazing on the mountainside above would hear the cry, he knew, and amble to his door. Call the mule, change into his traveling dress, assemble his few effects&#x2013;soon, soon, he would be on his way and gone.<br><br>Gone&#x2013;<br><br>His old heart revived as he looked ahead. Out in the open air, wearing the woodland green with his wand in his hand, he would be part of the wild wood again, one with the forest creatures who had always taken him as their own. And already he could feel the call of the road. The highways were not as good as they had been when the Roman legions marched away, but they would serve. And no one alive, no, not even the Old Ones who made the world, knew the lesser tracks and hidden greenways as Merlin did.<br><br>&#x201c;On your way, then, old fool!&#x201d; he chided himself. &#x201c;Leave your fireside, go!&#x201d; There was no time to waste if his thumbs were to be believed&#x2013;if he was to search out the evil now threatening Arthur and come once again to the rescue of the King&#x2013;if he was to discover what the warning meant and find the child.<br><br>Find the child.<br><br>Yes, that was what he must do.<br><br>With a racing pulse, Merlin began to prepare.<br><br>Avalon, Avalon, sacred island, home&#x2013;<br><br>The mist clung to the hillside like a living thing. The muffled figure went carefully downhill, though she had trodden the path a thousand times. When day broke, the towering pines and silver apple trees on the slopes would be easier to see. But now, in the darkness before dawn, she had to trust to her feet, not her eyes, to find the way.<br><br>Ahead of her the still waters of the Lake gleamed blackly in the darkness, ageless, impenetrable, pulsing with life. To her right a solitary lantern marked a stone jetty where two boatmen waited with their rough-headed lad, looking up in awe at the veiled figure as she drew near.<br><br>The boatmen came to meet her, squinting a silent greeting through thick fringes of black hair. Shyly they handed her into the boat and set off with a will, one rowing, the other poling from the stern, while the boy scrambled nimbly around, casting off and stowing the mooring rope. Then he doused the lantern, and the mist of night took them in its dank embrace.<br><br>The low barge drove onward through the dark.

In the howling speed-turmoil of a BSA M20 doing seventy, they were the only quiet things in the hurtling flesh and metal. Protected by the glass of the goggles, they stared fixedly ahead from just above the centre of the handlebars, and their dark, unwavering focus was that of gun muzzles. Below the goggles, the wind had got into the face through the mouth and had wrenched the lips back into a square grin that showed big tombstone teeth and strips of whitish gum. On both sides of the grin the cheeks had been blown out by the wind into pouches that fluttered slightly. To right and left of the hurtling face under the crash helmet, the black gauntlets, broken-wristed at the controls, looked like the attacking paws of a big animal.</p> <p>The man was dressed in the uniform of a dispatch-rider in the Royal Corps of Signals, and his machine, painted olive green, was, with certain modifications to the valves and the carburettor and the removal of some of the silencer baffles to give more speed, identical with a standard British Army machine. There was nothing in the man or his equipment to suggest that he was not what he appeared to be, except a fully loaded Luger held by a clip to the top of the petrol tank.</p> <p>It was seven o'clock on a May morning and the dead straight road through the forest glittered with the tiny luminous mist of spring. On both sides of the road the moss- and flower- carpeted depths between the great oak trees held the theatrical enchantment of the royal forests of Versailles and St Germain. The road was D98, a secondary road serving local traffic in the St Germain area, and the motorcyclist had just passed beneath the Paris-Mantes autoroute already thundering with commuter traffic for Paris. He was heading north towards St Germain and there was no one else in sight in either direction, except, perhaps half a mile ahead, an almost identical figure - another Royal Corps dispatch-rider. He was a younger, slimmer man and he sat com-fortably back on his machine, enjoying the morning and keeping his speed to around forty. He was well on time and it was a beautiful day. He wondered whether to have his eggs fried or scrambled when he got back to HQ around eight.</p> <p>Five hundred yards, four hundred, three, two, one. The man coming up from behind slowed to fifty. He put his right gauntlet up to his teeth and pulled it off. He stuffed the gauntlet between the buttons of his tunic and reached down and unclipped the gun.</p> <p>By now he must have been big in the driving-mirror of the young man ahead, for suddenly the young man jerked his head round, surprised to find another dispatch-rider on his run at that time of the morning. He expected that it would be an American or perhaps French military police. It might be anyone from the eight NATO nations that made up the staff of SHAPE, but when he recognized the uniform of the Corps he was astonished and delighted. Who the hell could it be? He raised a cheerful right thumb in recognition and cut his speed to thirty, waiting for the other man to drift up alongside. With one eye on the road ahead and the other on the approaching silhouette in the mirror, he ran through the names of the British riders in the Special Service Transportation Unit at Headquarters Command. Albert, Sid, Wally - might be Wally, same thick build. Good show! He'd be able to pull his leg about that little frog bit in the canteen - Louise, Elise, Lise - what the hell was her name. &#x2014; The man with the gun had slowed. Now he was fifty yards away. His face, undistorted by the wind, had set into blunt, hard, perhaps Slav lines. A red spark burned behind the black, aimed muzzles of the eyes. Forty yards, thirty. A single magpie flew out of the forest ahead of the young dispatch-rider. It fled clumpsily across the road into the bushes behind a Michelin sign that said that St Germain was one kilometre to go. The young man grinned and raised an ironical finger in salute and self-protection - 'One magpie is sorrow'. &#x2014; Twenty yards behind him the man with the gun took both hands off the handlebars, lifted the Luger, rested it carefully on his left forearm and fired one shot. &#x2014; The young man's hands whipped off his controls and met across the centre of his backward-arching spine. His machine veered across the road, jumped a narrow ditch and ploughed into a patch of grass and lilies of the valley. There it rose up on its screaming back wheel and slowly crashed backwards on top of its dead rider. The BSA coughed and kicked and tore at the young man's clothes and at the flowers, and then lay quiet. &#x2014; The killer executed a narrow turn and stopped with his machine pointing back the way he had come. He stamped down the wheel-rest, pulled his machine up on to it and walked in among the wild flowers under the trees. He knelt down beside the dead man and brusquely pulled back an eyelid. Just as roughly he tore the black leather dispatch-case off the corpse and ripped open the buttons of the tunic and removed a battered leather wallet. He wrenched a cheap wristwatch so sharply off the left wrist that the chrome expanding bracelet snapped in half. He stood up and slung the dispatch-case over his shoulder. While he stowed the wallet and the watch away in his tunic pocket he listened. There were only forest sounds and the slow tick of hot metal from the crashed BSA. The killer retraced his steps to the road. He walked slowly, scuffing leaves over the tyre marks in the soft earth and moss. He took extra trouble over the deep scars in the ditch and the grass verge, and then stood beside his motor-cycle and looked back towards the lily of the valley patch. Not bad! Probably only the police dogs would get it, and, with ten miles of road to cover, they would be hours, perhaps days - plenty long enough. The main thing in these jobs was to have enough safety margin. He could have shot the man at forty yards, but he had preferred to get to twenty. And taking the watch and the wallet had been nice touches - pro touches.</p> <p>Pleased with himself, the man heaved his machine off its rest, vaulted smartly into the saddle and kicked down on the starter. Slowly, so as not to show skid marks, he accelerated away back down the road and in a minute or so he was doing seventy again and the wind had redrawn the empty turnip grin across his face.</p> <p>Around the scene of the killing, the forest, which had held its breath while it was done, slowly began to breathe again. James Bond had his first drink of the evening at Fouquet's. It was not a solid drink. One cannot drink seriously in French cafes. Out of doors on a pavement in the sun is no place for vodka or whisky or gin. A fine a 1'eau is fairly serious, but it intoxicates without tasting very good. A quart de champagne or a champagne a I'orange is all right before luncheon, but in the evening one quart leads to another quart and a bottle of indif-ferent champagne is a bad foundation for the night. Pernod is possible, but it should be drunk in company, and anyway Bond had never liked the stuff because its liquorice taste reminded him of his childhood. No, in cafes you have to drink the least offensive of the musical comedy drinks that go with them, and Bond always had the same thing - an Americano - Bitter Campari, Cinzano, a large slice of lemon peel and soda. For the soda he always stipulated Perrier, for in his opinion expensive soda water was the cheapest way to improve a poor drink.</p> <p>When Bond was in Paris he invariably stuck to the same addresses. He stayed at the Terminus Nord, because he liked station hotels and because this was the least pretentious and most anonymous of them. He had luncheon at the Cafe de la Paix, the Rotonde or the Dome, because the food was good enough and it amused him to watch the people. If he wanted a solid drink he had it at Harry's Bar, both because of the solidity of the drinks and because, on his first ignorant visit to Paris at the age of sixteen, he had done what Harry's advertise-ment in the Continental Daily Mail had told him to do and had said to his taxi-driver 'Sank Roo Doe Noo'. That had started one of the memorable evenings of his life, culminating in the loss, almost simultaneous, of his virginity and his notecase. For dinner. Bond went to one of the great restaurants - Vefour, the Caneton, Lucas-Carton or the Cochon d'Or. These he considered, whatever Michelin might say about the Tour d'Argent, Maxims and the like, to have somehow avoided the tarnish of the expense account and the dollar. Anyway, he preferred their cooking. After dinner he generally went to the Place Pigalle to see what would happen to him. When, as usual, nothing did, he would walk home across Paris to the Gare du Nord and go to bed.</p> <p>Tonight Bond decided to tear up this dusty address book and have himself an old-fashioned ball. He was on his way through Paris after a dismally failed assignment on the Austro-Hungarian border. It had been a question of getting a certain Hungarian out. Bond had been sent from London specially to direct the operation over the head of Station V. This had been unpopular with the Vienna Station. There had been misunderstandings - wilful ones. The man had been killed in the frontier minefield. There would have to be a court of inquiry. Bond was due back at his London headquarters on the following day to make his report, and the thought of it all depressed him. Today had been so beautiful -one of those days when you almost believe that Paris is beautiful and gay - and Bond had decided to give the town just one more chance. He would somehow find himself a girl who was a real girl, and he would take her to dinner at some make-believe place in the Bois like the Armenonville. To clean the money-look out of her eyes - for it would certainly be there - he would as soon as possible give her fifty thousand francs. He would say to her: 'I propose to call you Donatienne, or possibly Solange, because these are names that suit my mood and the evening. We knew each other before and you lent me this money becaus...</p></p><h2>No Opportunity Wasted : Creating a List for Life</h2><p><p>Face Your Fears * Rediscover Your Childhood * Test Your Limits * Shed Your Inhibitions</p><p>From renowned adventurer and rising television star, Phil Keoghan, <i> No Opportunity Wasted: Creating a List for Life</i> combines the self-improvement appeal of an inspirational book with the adrenaline-rush of an adventure story.

At the moment, I don't know which way is up or down. Inside a watery cavern that was once this ship's ballroom, my body is suspended sideways; the only thing that keeps me from free-floating is that I'm hanging on to the side of an anchored table by my fingertips. In the not-too-distant past, before this luxurious ship sank to the floor of the sea, this table was probably a spot where passengers shared cocktails and conversation. Must've been swell. But now it's just me, hanging on for dear life. I am beginning to wonder if this could be the end. I'm 19 years old. I try not to panic. If I get too excited, my breathing will become irregular, and this will cause more problems with the regulator on my scuba air tank (I've already sucked in a few mouthfuls of salty water). I'm painfully aware that I have a finite amount of air in that tank, and that every minute I stay here, clinging to the table, is another minute lost. Should I be using these precious minutes to try to swim my way out of here? Maybe. Except I have no idea where to go. The inside of this ship is a labyrinth-all watery passages of indistinguishable gray silt walls, everything looking the same in the darkness. I would get more lost trying to navigate that maze. So I'm just staying put for now, hoping that help is on the way. In the meantime, I'm alone with my thoughts. And they are not pleasant ones. For example, I am becoming extremely conscious, for the first time in years, of the claustrophobia I first felt years earlier, as a small boy. My mind flashes on an old image: the dark inside of a box, held over me by a couple of my young pals. They were just fooling around, but inside the box I was overcome with terror, flailing my arms against the cardboard until the boys let me out. Of course, everything was fine once the box was lifted; I laughed it off with everyone else. My current situation, unfortunately, is more worrisome. The mind races at times such as these. Mine is filled with not just memories and fears, but questions. First and foremost: How the hell did I ever get myself into this mess? The only answer-it's not a good one, I know- is that it's hard for a 19-year-old to resist an adventure, especially when it's part of his job. I'd just landed a dream gig working on a local New Zealand adventure TV show, and this happened to be one of my assignments: to dive down to where a sunken cruise ship lay abandoned, the waterlogged remains of a terrible accident 2 years earlier that had forced people in elegant evening attire to jump ship. Before this dive, I was giddy with anticipation. The 22,000-ton behemoth promised to be a kind of lost world, untouched and unseen by the public since the calamity had occurred. I was also undeniably nervous. I'd never done anything like this and wasn't sure how well I'd take to being underwater, in the dark, and in a confined space. To make matters worse, I wasn't qualified to do a dive like this, didn't have a safety line, and didn't even have proper light sources. None of this stopped me from strapping on scuba gear and diving right in, following close behind another diver from the salvage crew. We swam down 20, then 60, then 100 feet. Gradually, I caught sight of the massive ship, lodged on its starboard side in the ocean floor. It was breathtaking. I'd have been content to swim around studying the exterior of the shipwreck, but the diver I was following-one of the only people who'd been inside the sunken ship previously-quickly swam toward a small open porthole, lunged through it, and vanished into the ship. Without hesitating, I followed him down that hole. Soon we were gliding through the liquid corridors of the ship. It was dark, but with the light of our flashlight we glimpsed a strangely beautiful world, embalmed in a monochrome film of silt. We swam into the ship's ballroom, where much of the interior remained intact but was now turned sideways-including the tables and chairs still bolted to the floor and a crystal chandelier that swayed from what was once the ceiling. I noticed floating suitcases and wondered what was inside them. We were supposed to wait there in the ballroom for an underwater camera crew to join us. As we settled in to wait, my fellow diver signaled to switch our lights off to save battery power, and everything went pitch- black. Time passed as we bobbed silently in the cold and eerie darkness. The camera crew didn't show up. We weren't sure what to do. Should we look for the camera crew? Maybe they were lost. At that point, we made the mistake of splitting up-the other diver went off to look for the crew, while I stayed behind to see if they would show up. It didn't take long for me to realize that I was in a very vulnerable situation now: I had a limited air supply, and no idea where I was in this ship. I don't know how long I was alone like that. But I know that at a certain point in time, the aloneness, the uncertainty, the darkness, the quiet, and the claustrophobia all came together and had a powerful effect on me. For the first time in my life, I felt the grip of panic. Which brings me back to where I began this story: hanging on, and trying not to think too much. And yet I couldn't stop thinking...I thought of possibilities and scenarios, some hopeful and some bleak. I was riding a kind of emotional seesaw: One moment I was up high, reassuring myself that "it's okay, someone will show up soon, just stay calm." The next moment, I felt myself descending to the bottom of the seesaw, the dark side where reason gives way to panic, and where doubt ("How do you know anyone's coming back?") overrides faith. Gradually, the seesaw became unbalanced, with fear outweighing all else. And along with fear, what was slowly seeping into my mind was a feeling of regret. What if it did all end here- with me pathetically clinging to this little table (I can even imagine the absurd headline: "Man Drowns in Shipwreck-Two Years Later!"). What if I never got to do all the things I'd been planning to do-all those crazy things I'd dreamed about while growing up? If it's hard to say goodbye to the life you've lived, it's even harder to say goodbye to a life you have yet to live. But I was beginning to say that farewell-the seesaw was down for good, it seemed-when everything started to cloud up and dissolve. And what came next was...nothingness.</p><h2>Waiting for First Light: My Ongoing Battle with PTSD</h2><p><b><b>Longlisted for the RBC Taylor Prize:&nbsp;</b>In this piercing memoir, Rom�o Dallaire, retired general and former senator, the author of the bestsellers&nbsp;<i>Shake Hands with the Devil</i>&nbsp;and<i>They Fight Like Soldiers, They Die Like Children,</i>&nbsp;and one of the world's leading humanitarians, delves deep into his life since the Rwandan genocide.</b><br>At the heart of <i>Waiting for First Light</i> is a no-holds-barred self-portrait of a top political and military figure whose nights are invaded by despair, but who at first light faces the day with the renewed desire to make a difference in the world. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rom�o Dallaire, traumatized by witnessing genocide on an imponderable scale in Rwanda, reflects in these pages on the nature of PTSD and the impact of that deep wound on his life since 1994, and on how he motivates himself and others to humanitarian work despite his constant struggle. Though he had been a leader in peace and in war at all levels up to deputy commander of the Canadian Army, his PTSD led to his medical dismissal from the Canadian Forces in April 2000, a blow that almost killed him. But he crawled out of the hole he fell into after he had to take off the uniform, and he has been inspiring people to give their all to multiple missions ever since, from ending genocide to eradicating the use of child soldiers to revolutionizing officer training so that our soldiers can better deal with the muddy reality of modern conflict zones and to revolutionizing our thinking about the changing nature of conflict itself.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His new book is as compelling and original an account of suffering and endurance as Joan Didion's <i>The Year of Magical Thinking </i>and William Styron's <i>Darkness Visible</i>.</p><p><b>ROM�O DALLAIRE </b>is a retired lieutenant-general, retired Canadian senator, and celebrated humanitarian. In 1993, LGen Dallaire was appointed force commander for UNAMIR, where he bore witness to the Rwandan genocide. His Governor General's Literary Award-winning book,&nbsp;<i>Shake Hands with the Devil,</i>&nbsp;exposed the failures of the international community to stop that genocide. It has been turned into an Emmy Award-winning documentary as well as a feature film; it has also been entered into evidence in war crimes tribunals trying the perpetrators of the Rwandan genocide. Dallaire has received numerous honours and awards, including Officer of the Order of Canada in 2002 and the United Nations Association in Canada&#x2019;s Pearson Peace Medal in 2005. His second book,&nbsp;<i>They Fight Like Soldiers, They Die Like Children,</i>&nbsp;was also a national bestseller. Since his retirement, he has become an outspoken advocate for human rights, mental health and war-affected children. He founded the Rom�o Dallaire Child Soldiers Initiative, an organization committed to progressively ending the use of child soldiers worldwide through a security sector approach.&nbsp;<br><br><b>JESSICA DEE HUMPHREYS</b>&nbsp;is co-author of&nbsp;the&nbsp;acclaimed bestsellers&nbsp;<i>Child Soldier: How Boys and Girls are Used in War&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>They Fight Like Soldiers, They Die Like Children.</i><b>Longlisted for the 2017 RBC Taylor Prize</b><br><br>&#x201c;[A]n important look at the plight of returning soldiers. . . . <b>Dallaire&#x2019;s work adds to a growing understanding of the special challenges and traumas faced by peacekeepers</b>. . . .

With brutal honesty and characteristically unsparing of himself, he shows the reader how PTSD has caused unshakable guilt, perennial insomnia, persistent distress, complicated family difficulties and spiritual angst. <b>Although this book is about pain, it is not about despair. It is a triumph.</b> His understanding of human suffering at a very personal and intense level has propelled him into his current role as a champion for many important humanitarian causes such as the plight of child soldiers. By looking his demons in the eye and holding that gaze despite institutional ignorance and inaction, General Dallaire has transformed the Canadian military so that servicemen and women with PTSD may now acquire the treatment and support they need. <b>This book is a compelling, evocative, educational and riveting inspiration to all of us.</b>&#x201d; &#x2014;<b>Matthew J.

Taking each house on its own terms, Gleason's photographs present the buildings and their environs sharply and without deception. Accompanying the photographs are captions that give a brief architectural evaluation of each house and provide notes on its construction, history, and present condition.</p><p>Gleason has organized his book as a journey along the waterways that were the lifeline of Louisiana's plantations, their link to New Orleans and to the markets and factories of the North. Beginning in the vicinity of New Orleans and the lower Mississippi, Gleason presents such houses as Evergreen, with its columns and twin circular staircases; the exuberant San Francisco; and Oak Alley, set at the end of a spectacular avenue of 28 oak trees. Continuing along the bayous that lead into the western part of the state, he shows us the palatial Madewoood, constructed from seasoned timbers and 60,000 slave-made bricks; the meticulously restored Shadows-on-the-Teche; the ramshackle Darby House; and Bubenzer, which served as a Union army headquarters during the Civil War.From Cane River country and north Louisiana, the photographs portray Magnolia, burned by Union troops and then rebuilt to its original specifications; Melrose, built in the early 1830s by a freed slave; and Oakland, the location for the Civil War movie The Horse Soldiers. Moving overland towards Natchez; the elaborate, octagonal Longwood; Rosemont, the boyhood home of Jefferson Davis; Oakley, where John James Audubon was once engaged as a tutor; and Rosedown, with its elaborate gardens.Continuing south of Baton Rouge along the River Road, Gleason closes his tour with homes including Mount Hope, built in the eighteenth century; Nottoway, the largest plantation home in the South, completed on the eve of the Civil War; Indian Camp, a leprosarium for most of its existence; and the pillared galleries of Belle Helene.</p><p>The plantation homes of Louisiana were highly personal expressions of pride and faith in the future. Yet the building of these spectacular monuments was a brief phenomenon. In the wake of the Civil War, the South's economy was devoted to survival, not luxury. A tribute to the plantation home, David King Gleason's photographs reveal the beauty, grandeur, and poignance of these monuments.</p></p><p><p>David King Gleason (1927-1992) was a professional photographer based in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. His other books include Baton Rouge, Over New Orleans, Over Boston, Over Miami, Antebellum Homes of Georgia, Virginia Plantation Homes, and Atlanta.</p></p><h2>Aaron Rose Photographs</h2><p>&#x201c;His images invariably give the viewer the sense that he is seeing something as never before&#x2014;that he is seeing the world not merely reinterpreted but as profoundly rethought.&#x201d; <p> </p><p>&#x2014;Paul Goldberger, New York Times <br> Aaron Rose has created one of the most remarkable bodies of work of any photographer living today, and for most of his career he did this in isolation, in a single-minded quest for visual enlightenment. He was virtually unknown to the photography world until five of his prints were exhibited at the 1997 Whitney Biennial, when he was in his late fifties. <br> Rose&#x2019;s images&#x2014;completely original visions of trees and plants; sun, stars, and clouds; shells; the New York City skyline&#x2014;are miracles of light and chemistry. A magician who builds his own cameras and mixes complex developing solutions incorporating exotic metals, Rose has spent the last 35 years taking and superbly printing more than 25,000 photographs, most of them from negatives that he printed once or twice and then put away forever. This book offers the first-ever presentation of Rose&#x2019;s work, which has been quietly collected by major museums over the past few years, as well as a vivid portrait of the man himself, speaking to author Alfred Corn about photography, science, art, and commitment.</p></p><p>Alfred Corn is a poet, novelist, critic, and adjunct professor of writing at Columbia University in New York. His articles and reviews have appeared in the New York Times Book Review, The Nation, ARTnews, and other major publications. A Fellow of the Academy of American Poets and the recipient of Guggenheim, National Endowment for the Arts, and Fulbright fellowships, Corn&#39;s books include Notes from a Child of Paradise, The Various Light, and All Roads at Once, among others.*Starred Review* God's first creation in the Book of Genesis is light, presumably so that the heavens and the earth, already in place, could be seen. Photography is preeminently the art of light, and the photographs of Aaron Rose suggest what God's first glances may have been like. They aren't the sharply focused recordings of life that most photographs seem intended to be. Because Rose makes very long exposures, which are necessary with the lensless pinhole camera he uses, and because he very often aims at light, his pictures generalize and typify instead of defining and particularizing. Their soft-focus appearance, the result of changes in the quality of light over time, helps the final images resemble abstract expressionist paintings, as in those depicting reflections in clear glass objects, or ideal conceptions of their subjects, as in the views of Manhattan buildings obtained from rooftop camera placements. Besides using nonstandard equipment and exposures, Rose prepares his own developing solutions to tint his pictures monochromatically (he never uses color film) and bring them emotionally and spiritually closer to his recollected visual experience. His personalizing procedures are the most but not the only thought-provoking aspects of Rose that Corn discusses in his essay on and elicits in his interview with the photographer. Orphaned in infancy and on his own since age 14, Rose was a professional photographer only briefly, earning his livelihood instead as an antique tool collector-dealer and longtime landlord in New York's SoHo district. For those who love art photography, this is probably the book of the year. <i>Ray Olson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Classic expressions of conscience like Thoreau&#x2019;s seminal&nbsp;&#x201c;Civil Disobedience&#x201d; lay the groundwork for such influential modern theorists of nonviolence as David&nbsp;Dellinger, Thomas Merton, and Barbara Deming. The long arc of the American antiwar movement is vividly&nbsp;traced in the urgent appeals of activists, made in soaring oratory and galvanizing song, and in dramatic dispatches&nbsp;from the front lines of antiwar protests. The voices of veterans, from the Civil War to the Iraq War, are prominently&nbsp;represented, as is the firsthand testimony of conscientious objectors. Contemporary writers, including&nbsp;Barbara Kingsolver, Jonathan Schell, Nicholson Baker, and Jane Hirshfield, demonstrate the ongoing richness&nbsp;of this literature in the years since September 11, 2001. Featuring more than 150 eloquent and provocative&nbsp;writers in all, <i>War No More </i>is a bible for activists, a go-to resource for scholars and students, and an inspiring&nbsp;and fascinating story for every reader interested in the crosscurrents of war and peace in American history.<br><br><b>LIBRARY OF AMERICA</b>&nbsp;is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation&#x2019;s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America&#x2019;s best and most significant writing.

A companion piece to Levering's <i>Engaging the Doctrine of Revelation</i>, this work critically engages contemporary and classical doctrines of the Holy Spirit in dialogue with Orthodox and Reformed interlocutors.

Marshall</b>, Lehman Professor of Christian Doctrine, Perkins School of Theology, Southern Methodist University<br><br>"In this landmark achievement, Matthew Levering presents his theology of the Holy Spirit. The result is a deeply informed, robust, Catholic articulation of the person and work of the Holy Spirit, whose proper names are Love and Gift. It is rare to encounter such a remarkable range of biblical as well as doctrinal theologians, presented by way of irenic yet vigorous discussion.

A devotion is a behavior in service to love, truth, and God that will create powerful changes in the circumstances of your life that have held you down and back <i>until today!</i> </p><p> Whatever has been going on in your mind, your life, or your heart can stop -- <i>right now,</i> if that is truly what you desire. However, you must be willing to "do a new thing." You must spend a little time, each day, <i>in devotion</i> to the truth about yourself and the truth about life. You must make a conscious approach to what you think and how you feel about what you do. Devotion will clear up misconceptions that may have obscured your vision of life <i>until today!</i> </p><p> A <i>devotion</i> is a divine action. Its profound dedication demonstrates the desire to be in service to God. Since it is God's desire for you to be happy, any time spent in devotion will be beneficial. Your devotion, as a demonstration of your willingness to embrace new concepts and to undertake behaviors that support those concepts, will ultimately result in your happiness. When you are actively, willingly devoted to seeking a "good thing," the Divine Intelligence of life will guide, support, and reward you. </p><p> I am excited! It is exciting to be alive in a time when people are actively, willingly, and devotedly seeking ways to be of greater service and create more love in our collective experience. </p><p> I can hardly wait to see the good, the joy, and the peace that we can create. I am so grateful to be in support of and of service to you as you undertake this journey. Because I know that "where two or more are gathered" the Spirit of good is present, I believe that the things upon which we focus our hearts and minds will reap bountiful results. So, here's to your personal strength and your peace of mind, through the elimination of all things that hindered or denied our collective power and greatness --<i> Until Today!</i> </p><p> Be Blessed! </p><p> <i>Iyanla</i></p></p><p>This book of 365 daily devotionals supports the time-honored adage, "Why put off until tomorrow what you can do today?" The charismatic spiritual leader Iyanla Vanzant knows how easy it is to stay stuck in "old sentiments, resentments, beliefs, decisions, agreements, judgments, and ideas that may have become habitual." Through these devotions Vanzant hopes to show readers that the easiest way to create change is to simply shift your attitude--<i>today</i>. "We often work so hard to get the things we want that we miss the fact that it is the landscape of the inner world that stands between us and true happiness."<p> In the closing paragraph of each one-page devotional Vanzant names an old way of thinking and offers readers a new attitude to try on "just for today." For example, Vanzant writes, "Until today, you may have believed that you had to stay in the painful hole of hurt caused by the loss of a loved one. Just for today, make a conscious effort and choice to cover the hole and move on." Some might consider these devotions a fancy term for affirmations. Vanzant scoffs at the notion. Time spent in devotion is not a "New Age trick through which you can impose your will on God, the universe, or those around you," she writes. "Devotion is the reverent, personal act of surrendering your will to the Divine will." <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p>With more than 8 million books in print, <b>Iyanla Vanzant</b> has truly established a dedicated fan base. <p>Iyanla's path to success took her through a multitude of life-changing experiences that shaped the profound insights she eagerly shares with others. A neglected, overweight, sexually abused child who was shuttled from one family to another, she became a teenage mother on welfare living in the projects of a major urban city. Vanzant took control of her life when she walked out of her second abusive marriage and entered Medgar Evers College in New York and then the City University of New York Law School. She moved to Philadelphia with her children and became a public defender for three years. Then she eventually became an ordained minister, who was committed to a message based on the principles of divine power and self-determination. </p><p>Iyanla combined her professional skills with her life's lessons and embarked on a writing and speaking career. Her mass appeal is evident in her overwhelming success as an author. <i>In the Meantime</i> was a #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestseller, where it spent 20 weeks on the list, and she has had numerous other major bestsellers. As a nationally recognized speaker she has sold out such prestigious venues as New York's Jacob Javits Convention Center, Nashville's Grand Ole Opry, Atlanta's Civic Center, and the Wiltern Theater in Los Angeles. Vanzant is also familiar to the daytime TV audience from her role as a regular contributor on "The Oprah Winfrey Show." </p><p>Acclaimed journalist and producer Barbara Walters recognized Vanzant's extraordinary appeal, seeing in her a "breakaway talent" with the potential for huge success in daytime television.

Original.</p><p>The fourth installment in Asimov's "Robot Universe" finds Hunter, Steve, Judy and their colleagues time-traveling back to WW II Moscow in order to undo the nuclear destruction of Moscow, caused by one of their government's gestalt robots, which has gone renegade into the past. Although Wu's ( Perihelion ) protagonists are supposed to be crack government operatives--lead by Hunter, a super-sophisticated humanoid robot--all of them register dull surprise upon hearing of Moscow's total destruction. This installment lacks any of its namesake's famous wit, and it numbs the reader with juvenile philosophical arguments concerning Asimov's famous Three Laws of Robotics--Hunter, for instance, is constantly weighing his conflicting responsibilities under the laws. The agents' spouting of high school history facts, their ridiculous last-minute alibis to fool the Soviet secret police (Hunter claims he was a farm worker but can't name the farm) and their general bumbling provide inadvertent amusement. Readers can bet that another adventure awaits: upon the group's return, Steve grins when he hears that Beijing has been blown to bits. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>On Writing, Editing and Publishing: Essays Explicative and Hortatory</h2><p>A collection of eleven articles, written over a period of almost forty years and originally published in such journals as American Scholar, Atlantic Monthly, and Partisan Review.</p><p></p><h2>Smiley&#39;s Circus : A Guide to the Secret World of John Le Carre</h2><p>A comprehensive catalog of the byzantine operations of the &#34;Circus&#34; and the details surrounding the life of fictional spy George Smiley</p><p></p><h2>The Dictionary of Misinformation</h2><p>Sets the record straight on hundreds of misquotations, misinterpretations, misunderstandings, misconstruals, and mistakes in popular thought and belief</p><p></p><h2>Brasyl</h2><p>Think Bladerunner in the tropics... <br><br>Be seduced, amazed, and shocked by one of the world&#x2019;s greatest and strangest nations.

The connections of these worlds through the various ways in which people can perceive all possible universes, and the implications of the universe's unavoidable quantum entanglements--ranging from the possibility of predicting the future to the existence of nigh-infinite doubles of everyone--prove startling. McDonald's <i>Brasyl</i> is a magnificent place, and the motivations and possible results of the battle over the multitude of quantum universes it posits are chilling and wonderful. <i>Regina Schroeder</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Original.</p><p>Similar in style and structure to Little's previous books (The Association, etc.), this chilling tale revolves around a handful of tightly knit characters living in Tucson, Ariz.-including recently divorced Hunt Jackson, his new wife, his co-workers and his best buddy from high school-who are continually harassed by a pesky insurance salesman. The salesman tries to convince them to purchase bizarre policies protecting them from the law, their bosses and even death, and if the clients refuse, inexplicable consequences usually follow. When Jackson turns down additional insurance, for example, he is incomprehensibly charged with child molestation and thrown in jail. Then he buys so-called conviction insurance while behind bars, and the alleged victim is killed in a car accident. One of Little's primary strengths is his ability to create believable characters whose lives are disrupted by a seemingly mundane yet supernatural force. Those characters then emerge as heroes by single-handedly defeating that force-in this case, an omnipotent insurance company that is bent on destroying the world one policyholder at a time. That said, by this point in the author's career-this is his 14th novel-Little's approach, while still enjoyable, has become predictable. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.A master of horror on a par with Koontz and King. -- <i><i>Midwest Book Review</i></i><br><br>A master of the macabre. -- <i>Stephen King</i><br><br>If there's a better horror novelist working today, I don't know who it is. -- <i><i>Los Angeles Times</i></i></p><h2>DARK HORSES: Poets on Overlooked Poems</h2><p><p>Too many amazing poems end up overlooked by the academy and excluded from the canon, remaining largely unknown to the poetry-reading public.&nbsp; Joy Katz and Kevin Prufer&#x2019;s Dark Horses joyfully rediscovers dozens of these poems, recognizes their power, and illuminates their significance.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Seventy-five established American poets including Billy Collins, John Ashbery, Linda Bierds, Carl Phillips, C.

In <i>Pippi Goes to School</i>, our heroine's insurrectionary spirit is hardly dampened by her first taste of academe. Her friends Tommy and Annika head off bright and early at 8 a.m., "hand in hand, swinging their schoolbags." Pippi can't be bothered to get going until a little later: "At exactly ten o'clock she lifted her horse off the front porch, and a little later all the people in the town ran to their windows to see what horse it was that was running away." It's just Pippi headed for school in her own inimitable fashion. The teacher's vain attempts to teach her math and art and music fail miserably. When asked to add 7 and 5, she retorts, "If you don't know that yourself, you needn't think I'm going to tell you." It's not that Pippi's naughty, it's just that she has her own way of doing things. At the end of the day, it's she who's consoling the exhausted teacher: "You understand, Teacher, don't you, that when you have a mother who's an angel and father who's a cannibal king, and when you have sailed on the ocean all your whole life, then you don't know just how to behave in school." This slender paperback picture book is neatly adapted from the Astrid Lindgren classic <i>Pippi Longstocking</i>, with assistance from Lindgren herself. Michael Chesworth's lively, modernized illustrations make clever reference to the original edition, without being slavish.

It was followed by two sequels, <i>Pippi Goes on Board&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Pippi in the South Seas</i>. Ms. Lindgren had a long, prolific career, writing more than 100 picture books, poems, short stories, plays, screenplays, and novels.

I highly recommend this book at twice the price. --By A Customer<br><br>In 1949, just after World War II, all of the gun manufacturing companies faced a problem of selling guns in the commercial market. The Government had extensive stocks of guns like Endfields, Springfields, Colt .45's and of course any number of foreign guns and were beginning to sell these guns on the commercial market. It was obviously a stupid time to go into the gun manufacturing business. In 1949 Bill Ruger entered the gun business with one gun being manufactured by a very small company. The gun was the Ruger.22 Standard Pistol which was an instant hit and is still in production as the Mark III. Every few years since then there has been a new gun from the folk at Ruger, each of which has pioneered new design principles that has made nearly all of the guns a success. In this book, R.L. Wilson has produced a masterpiece of a book that describes all of the guns produced by the company as well as a history of the company and the man. It's an excellent addition to any gun lovers library. --By John Matlock</p><h2>Hedgehog&#39;s Secret</h2><p>"In the summer evening, stars are blinking. <br>Hedgehog strolls around while thinking. <br>Before too long she'll go to sleep<br>and into her dreams her treasure will creep.<br>What is her treasure?

At the end of the day the mystery is solved when Hedgehog introduces all her friends to her newborn treasure. <br></p><p><b>Lena Anderson</b> is the author of <i>Tick-Tock</i> and <i>Tea for Ten</i>, as well as the illustrator of many books, including the bestselling <i>Linnea in Monet's Garden</i>. She lives in Stockholm, Sweden.<br>Anderson (Tick-Tock; Tea for Ten) demonstrates how mixed signals can affect friendships in this cheerily illustrated volume. Hedgehog keeps the titular secret until the very last page. She spends the day scrubbing, washing, sweeping and mending, and has no time for her friends. Elephant suggests, " `Why don't we all of us go for a walk?'/ We could get some fresh air, and have time to talk.'/ `Oh no,' said Hedgehog. `I've no time for that stuff.'/ So Elephant starts to leave in a huff." Anderson's rhymes, at least as translated by Dyssegaard, aren't particularly remarkable or lyric. But the full-page and spot watercolor illustrations, rendered in the soft, pale colors of a baby's layette, have a sweet, old-fashioned feel. And the final scene, with neighbors fussing over Hedgehog's baby (that's the secret), sums up all that is wonderful about newborns. Unfortunately, Hedgehog's secret is also the book's flaw: while it is genuinely hard to guess what she is concealing, children may be confounded by Anderson's coyness. When and how long ago did the baby arrive? Why wouldn't she share her pregnancy with her friends?

Food therefore could be one of the more revealing indexes to personal and national proclivities, provided one could draw stable conclusions from an index so subject to individual and collective preference. The food of one&#39;s own country is too familiar to evoke anything but shadowy sensations; other peoples&#39; cuisine may be too startlingly different to be anything but confusing. Perhaps the best way to make a judgment about the matter is to taste one&#39;s own cuisine after a long abstention, in order to rediscover its real nature, much as jaded husbands sometimes are advised to do to rediscover their wives&#39; charms. I tried the culinary experiment once. I was a correspondent for the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera at the time, assigned to cover the marriage of a former King to an American lady, in a ch�teau near Tours. Most of the visiting journalists stayed at the H�tel de l&#39;Univers, in Tours, whose cuisine was above the average. We had time on our hands. The Anglo Saxons dedicated it to drinking a great number of identical drinks; others, myself included, to eating. Every day we chose a different bistro or restaurant to taste the local specialties and the wines that went with them, following the advice of well-qualified local inhabitants. Later, when we could leave the ch�teau for a few hours at a time, we began favoring the little buffet of a nearby country railroad station. It belonged to a secondary line on which I never saw a train pass. The stationmaster&#39;s wife was the cook and waitress. The menu was so simple that I suspected that we were eating an extension of the family&#39;s normal luncheon...</p><p></p><h2>Rebus&#39;s Scotland</h2><p>This evocative and stunningly produced book highlights the places that inspired the settings for the Inspector Rebus novels.

In this companion to Dr Laura's best-selling <i>The Proper Care and Feeding of Husbands</i>, women are the source of the problem and have the power of the solution. Wives, brainwashed by "feminism" and politically correct psychotherapy, have become dismissive of their husbands, denying them tenderness, pillow talk, admiration, and dinner on the table, says Schlessinger. Her prescription is deceptively simple. A wife must stop defining her power in terms of possessions, position, and independence. Instead, she should remember that "men are simpler in their emotional needs" (they are demoralized by not feeling cared for) and exercise her "awesome power to change her man and her marriage." The payoff? A husband who will "die for us"--and take out the garbage without being asked. Schlessinger coaxes readers in attitude adjustment through an assessment of their marriage and dozens of specific suggestions about compliments, conversation, counting blessings and lacy underwear. She is at her best in asking readers to explore anti-male bias in advertising and Internet jokes. Her tart commentary is interspersed with journal exercises, testimonial transcripts from her radio show, and listener letters. The book's central ideas (devotion robust listening, sensuality) are too often eclipsed by its gender typecasting of both partners and frequent frying of the feminist idea of mutuality in marriage. Both men and women will surely bristle at the book's anachronistic assumptions: for example, a silk teddy manipulates men and nothing spells loving like something from the oven. Dr. Laura's self-promotion and the defense and repetition of her earlier ideas also undermine her message. Still, it must be noted that many of her listeners and readers find Schlessinger's ten-minute marriage manager to be hopeful and helpful. <i>--Barbara Mackoff</i><p>Dr. Laura Schlessinger, a licensed marriage and family therapist, is one of the most popular talk-show hosts in radio history and the only woman to win the prestigious Marconi Award for syndicated radio.

He lives in London.</p>Chapter One <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Her Majesty's Secret Agent <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>On a morning in mid-March 2007, a dark blue car with a Scotland Yard Special Branch driver at the wheel made its way through the west suburbs of London toward the city center. The single passenger in the backseat, Sir John McLeod Scarlett, looked intimidating, the embodiment of the British establishment, a banker, perhaps, or the chairman of a large company. His customized suit, tailored by Gieves &amp; Hawkes, a handsewn shirt with double cuffs and his Travellers Club tie enhanced the impression. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Scarlett was Her Majesty's Secret Agent, a spymaster who had long understood that the chessboard of intelligence gathering has no rules. Now fifty-nine years old, he still had the cultivated drawl from a prep school education (Epsom College) and three years at Magdalen College, Oxford, where he studied history before joining MI6, the Secret Intelligence Service, entering a world where deception and betrayal would remain the cornerstone of his work. For thirty-two years his talents at spying and counterespionage steadily brought him promotion until finally he became its chief, the fourteenth to hold the post, and early in the year he had been knighted by the queen. Married with four adult children, three boys and a girl, he enjoyed collecting history books, visiting medieval churches, and fine dining. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Those pleasant pastimes fitted in with the massive mahogany desk in his office, which once graced the cabin of Admiral Lord Nelson on Victory and behind which Scarlett's predecessors had sat. On the desk was a Victorian inkwell, its pot filled with green ink, and beside it the Parker fountain pen Scarlett used to sign all his correspondence. A desk communications console had direct links to the prime minister, the head of MI5, the director of the CIA, and the chiefs of Europe's intelligence services. There was also a button that activated a phone three thousand miles away on the desk of the director-general of Mossad. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>The office furnishings were completed by a grandfather clock constructed down to the last flywheel by the first chief, Sir Mansfield Smith Cumming; almost a century later, it still kept perfect time. Cumming's order that all communications emanating from him were to be known as "intelligence product" and marked with the prefix "CX," an abbreviation for "Cumming Exclusive," remained in force. In his will he had bequeathed the agency a large oil painting of a group of French villagers facing a Prussian firing squad during the war of 1870, and as MI6 had moved from one headquarters to another around London, the picture followed. With it went the custom that Cumming was only addressed as Chief. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>When Scarlett had been appointed on May 6, 2004 as director-general of MI6, the queen had addressed him as such. He called her the first time "Your Majesty" and thereafter "ma'am." Protocol with both was inbred. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Attached to Scarlett's console was a tamper-proof computer that contained the current state of MI6 missions across the world: in Moscow, Beijing, Baghdad, and Tehran; in the depths of Amazonia and the jungles of Central Africa; in the mountains of Afghanistan and Pakistan: in all those places where Scarlett and his senior staff detected terrorist threats to the United Kingdom. It was hugely expensive to maintain the field operations, often requiring a score of people to service a single field agent "down the pipe." <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>MI6 is Britain's external Secret Intelligence Service and has a worldwide mandate. MI5, the Security Service, is responsible for internal security. MI6 is answerable to Britain's foreign secretary; MI5, to the home secretary. Both service heads are appointed by the incumbent prime minister and are represented on the Joint Intelligence Committee ( JIC), the link with the government. However, both the chief of MI6 and the director-general of MI5 also have immediate access to the prime minister of the day. The services work closely together in the current threat from global terrorism. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Since the al-Qaeda attack on the United States, September 11, 2001, however, budget considerations were no longer the main concern; MI6 was flush with money to conduct espionage, counterespionage, and electronic surveillance, whose gadgetry in 2007 remained the growth industry of the secret world. Scarlett's computer had a map listing the current state of the terrorist threat to the United Kingdom; on that March morning it was "severe," one level below "critical." <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Superimposed over London on the map was the figure 35, representing the number of Islamic networks MI6 believed were in the capital. Eighty were identified as operating within the Muslim communities in the Midlands, in Leicester, Birmingham, Derby, and Nottingham. Further north in the conurbation of Leeds, Bradford, and Manchester, there were another sixty networks. West, in the port city of Liverpool, twenty networks had been uncovered. Across the border into Wales, ten were pinpointed not only in the cities of Cardiff and Swansea but in the Brecon Beacon mountains, where suspected terrorists had been spotted training before the London bombings in July 2005. Twelve other networks were in Scotland, and across the Irish Sea were two more. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Most of the networks consisted of two or three members; a few comprised up to a dozen men and women. After becoming radicalized, they had melted into their community as sleeper agents maintaining contact with each other at Friday mosque prayers and biding their time for instructions to carry out an attack. Their deep cover was protected through their daily jobs as schoolteachers, college professors, doctors and nurses, shopkeepers and salespeople. The popular image of the uneducated terrorist of the IRA had long gone. Al-Qaeda sought to recruit university graduates rather than the street-corner dropouts. While the jihadists waited to be activated, they observed any procedural, legal, or cultural weaknesses in their society that could be exploited. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>The networks had produced Richard Reid, a British-born convert to Islamism who, in December 2001, tried to blow up a U.S. airliner bound from Paris to Miami with a bomb in his shoe. The July 2005 London bombers all belonged to a network; two, Mohammed Sidique Khan and Shehzad Tanweer, had trained as terrorists in Pakistan before returning to England to become sleeper agents. Four others had set up a poison factory in a peaceful suburb of north London, using techniques they had been taught by a chemist at an al-Qaeda training camp in Afghanistan before coming to Britain. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Even knowing the jihadists were there, taking action against them before they were about to strike was not easy. Neither MI5 nor MI6 had the power of arrest, and Britain's human rights lawyers made full use of the country's laws to challenge arrests made by the police. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>In a briefing to his senior managers on the day he became director general, Scarlett reminded them, "As we are in a global and totalitarian war against terrorism, we must continue to fully engage it on those terms." <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>In January 2007, a team of MI5 officers had flown to the war-torn African state of Somalia to try to obtain DNA samples from four Britishborn terrorists, who had been among a hundred jihadists killed in a U.S. bombing raid on an al-Qaeda training camp on the remote island of Lamu in the Indian Ocean. The men had been born and raised in Leeds and had told their families they were going to visit relatives in Islamabad. Instead they traveled to Somalia, joining other jihadists from France, Spain, Italy, and Germany. The passport details of the four Britons had provided an electronic footprint for their journey to Lamu, tracking them through Athens airport on to Mogadishu in the Horn of Africa. From there they had traveled to Lamu, arriving only days before the U.S. fighter-bombers struck. Immediately after the bombing their bodies were buried along with the other dead by their instructors, who then fled back to Mogadishu. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>The MI5 officers had flown from London to Kuwait and then to an American carrier on patrol in the Arabian Sea, from which U.S. Navy helicopters took them to Lamu. For three dangerous days, guarded by a combined force of SAS and Delta Force commandos, the officers had helped to dig up bodies buried in shallow graves. On the fourth day they unearthed the four Britons. Each still carried his passport. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Their DNA samples were flown out to the carrier and processed on board before being flown to London so forensic pathologists could match them against other DNA obtained from the unsuspecting families of the dead men. Experts from MI5's technical support department, using the passport information, had located addresses for members of the dead men's families. An officer posing as a local health employee checking on contamination of the local water supply due to broken pipes after unseasonable flooding, had called on each address and taken swabs. These had been driven to London, where a Home Office scientist conducted comparison tests on the DNA recovered from the Lamu bodies. In each case there was a perfect match. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>MI6 calculated there were still some 1,600 potential terrorists spread across Britain. It had been one of the first points Scarlett made to Gordon Brown, the prime-minister-in-waiting, during his initial intelligence briefing. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Tony Blair, in the sunset of his ten-year premiership, had been Scarlett's political mentor and protector in the jungle of Whitehall. Yet against Scarlett's advice, Blair had made an extraordinary choice and announced his early retirement from politics with two years of his term remaining. It left him a lame-duck leader, the object of media ridicule and fierce internal sniping within his own cabinet. Within MI6 there was speculation that when Blair left office, Scarlett would soon follow. Critics had not forgotten the damage he had brought upon MI6 following those halcyon days when the Blair Crisis Cabinet had met in the runup to the Iraq War in 2003 and Scarlett had read aloud, from his buff-colored file with the red cross of St. George on its cover, the latest intelligence from Baghdad. Blair had given him a place at the cabinet table, as chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee, and had seized upon every word of Scarlett's to support his own belief that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction, or WMD. The claim was enshrined in a document signed by Blair and presented to Parliament, one to which Scarlett had made a major contribution. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>By the time the Crisis Cabinet became the War Cabinet after the invasion of Iraq, Scarlett surely knew Saddam had no warheads filled with smallpox to rain down plague on his enemies, no mobile chemical weapons laboratories roaming the Iraqi deserts at night to launch mass death, no nuclear rockets capable of being fired in forty-five minutes against the coalition forces mustering in Kuwait. There were no WMD of any kind to be found. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>When it emerged that it had been Scarlett who pressed for the inclusion of what became known as "the golden nuggets"&#x2014;the very reason Bush and Blair had gone to war with Iraq&#x2014;and that those "nuggets" turned out to be fantasies based on highly dubious intelligence sources, Scarlett became the object of intense public criticism calling for his resignation. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Instead Tony Blair had appointed him as the director-general of MI6. Within the Secret Intelligence Service there was stunned disbelief. The appointment was seen by many officers as no more than repayment by Blair for Scarlett's support over WMD. That view was shared in the corridors of the Ministry of Defense and at Langley. One CIA officer who had been directly involved in the search for WMD told the author, "Until the golden nuggets, Scarlett had a good reputation. Not anymore. If Blair was Bush's poodle, Scarlett was Blair's donkey." <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>In Washington the issue of WMD had ensured Scarlett's footprint would be clear in all subsequent assessments of the Iraq War; he was the intelligence chief who had made a disastrous error. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>John Scarlett now had an opportunity to show his peers that MI6, under his command, could carry out an operation that would become a hallmark of careful planning and derring-do and would restore his reputation in the secret world of intelligence and with the new government of Gordon Brown. For the rest&#x2014;the media commentators on the Sunday morning talk shows, the retired analysts turned pundits&#x2014;he would continue to dismiss them as "legless men trying to teach running." The operation would be a fitting climax to his long career. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>ONE OF HIS OXFORD INSTRUCTORS was a talent spotter for MI6. After Scarlett had passed through its training school at Fort Monkton near Gosport in Hampshire, he was posted to Nairobi. Among his first calls was to the Oasis Club near the city's venerable Norfolk Hotel. The club had long been a favorite among Kenya's business and political communities and the city's foreign spies. Patrons could drink from dusk to dawn in its gloomy interior and risk taking a bar girl to one of the rooms out back after checking that her latest medical certificate promised she was free from AIDS. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Moshe Goldberg, a Mossad katsa, a field officer, had met Scarlett when he was familiarizing himself with the city and had invited Scarlett to have a drink in the club. Late in the evening they had been joined by a South African intelligence officer: Sober, the man was an amusing raconteur; drunk, he could become boorish and violent. When a barman brought them a new round of drinks, he accidentally spilled a glass over the South African's safari suit. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>"The man lunged at him. Scarlett stood up and restrained him. The whole club fell silent. Scarlett quietly told the waiter to bring fresh drinks and turned to the South African and said this wasn't Cape Town. It was an object lesson in the use of confidence coupled to certainty," recalled Goldberg. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>In Kenya, Scarlett used his social skills to good advantage; he was well read and enjoyed watching polo and partying. His reports to London were regarded as some of the best informed on the impact that the Russians and Chinese were having on Kenya. His time there was followed by a posting to Moscow, the most dangerous place for a spy. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Scarlett was completing his second tour in the Russian capital when, in January 1994, the KGB caught him meeting one of his contacts, Vladimir Sinstov, whom Scarlett had recruited the year before at an arms fair in London. Sinstov was the export manager for a Moscow weapons company. Russian intelligence officers had pounced on the two men in a caf� near the Kremlin. Scarlett had just paid Sinstov for the most recent details of arms sales to Syria and Iraq and the names of Sinstov's contacts in Budapest, Paris, and Damascus. Scarlett was expelled and Sinstov sentenced to ten years' hard labor in a Siberian gulag. He would die there.

Determined and heroically hardheaded, Djilas suffered brutalities at the hands of King Alexander&#39;s police. Undeterred, he continued to organize, write, publish, learn. For a while Djilas tried to combine his literary ambitions with his political ideals. But he soon realized that his &#34;poetic passion&#34; was in conflict with his revolutionary discipline. There is iron determination in this man who became, under Tito&#39;s leadership, a chief architect of the Communist revolution. The Yugoslav Communists built an organization strong enough to resist both Hitler&#39;s Germany and Stalin&#39;s Russia. A tightly knot group personally and politically, they enforced a personal morality that drove some dedicated men to despair. Djilas helped to mild minds; others organized cadres. With Tito, Djilas maintained a special &#34;father-and-son relationship.&#34; With almost perfect recall, Djilas tells of these years of struggle and triumph, of the time spent in prison, which was, he says, &#34;perhaps the most important school ... for our spiritual transformation.&#34; This book is a rare study of human commitment.</p><p>Text: English (translation)</p><h2>American Sutra: A Story of Faith and Freedom in the Second World War</h2><p><p><b>This groundbreaking history tells the little-known story of how, in one of our country&#x2019;s darkest hours, Japanese Americans fought to defend their faith and preserve religious freedom.</b></p><p>The mass incarceration of Japanese Americans during World War II is not only a tale of injustice; it is a moving story of faith. In this pathbreaking account, Duncan Ry&#x16b;ken Williams reveals how, even as they were stripped of their homes and imprisoned in camps, Japanese American Buddhists launched one of the most inspiring defenses of religious freedom in our nation&#x2019;s history, insisting that they could be both Buddhist and American.</p><p>Nearly all Americans of Japanese descent were subject to bigotry and accusations of disloyalty, but Buddhists aroused particular suspicion. Government officials, from the White House to small-town mayors, believed that Buddhism was incompatible with American values. Intelligence agencies targeted the Buddhist community for surveillance, and Buddhist priests were deemed a threat to national security. On December 7, 1941, as the bombs fell on Pearl Harbor, Attorney General Francis Biddle issued a warrant to &#x201c;take into custody all Japanese&#x201d; classified as potential national security threats. The first person detained was Bishop Giky&#x14d; Kuchiba, leader of the Nishi Hongwanji Buddhist sect in Hawai&#x2018;i.</p><p>In the face of discrimination, dislocation, dispossession, and confinement, Japanese Americans turned to their faith to sustain them, whether they were behind barbed wire in camps or serving in one of the most decorated combat units in the European theater. Using newly translated sources and extensive interviews with survivors of the camps and veterans of the war, <i>American Sutra</i> reveals how the Japanese American community broadened our country&#x2019;s conception of religious freedom and forged a new American Buddhism.</p></p><p>An ordained Buddhist priest in the Soto Zen tradition, Duncan Ry&#x16b;ken Williams has spent years piecing together the story of the Japanese American community during World War II.

He has published five other books, including <i>The Other Side of Zen</i>.&#x201c;<i>American Sutra</i> tells the story of how Japanese American Buddhist families like mine survived the wartime incarceration.

In a long preface, "Frame Structures," written especially for this volume, Howe suggests the autobiographical, familial, literary, and historical motifs that suffuse these early works. Taken together, the preface and poems reflect her rediscovered sense of her own beginnings as a poet, her movement from the visual arts into the iconography of the written word.</p><p>Susan Howe is a professor of English at the State University of New York&#x2015;Buffalo. Most of her later poetry has been collected in <em>The Nonconformist's Memorial</em> (New Directions, 1993), <em>The Europe of Trusts: Selected Poems</em> (Sun &amp; Moon Press, 1990), and <em>Singularities</em> (Wesleyan University Press, 1990). She is also the author of two landmark books of postmodernist criticism, <em>The Birth-mark: unsettling the wilderness in American literary history</em> (Wesleyan University Press, 1993) and <em>My Emily Dickinson</em> (North Atlantic Books, 1985).<br></p></p><p>Susan Howe has won the Bollingen Prize, the Frost Medal, and the Griffin Award. She is the author of such seminal works as Debths, That This, The Midnight, My Emily Dickinson, The Quarry, and The Birthmark.This eagerly awaited edition brings back into print four of five long-poem chapbooks with which Howe moved from the visual arts into poetry. The interplay is readily apparent. Howe compresses her lines into "fields" of text, where rhymes and the ghost of the pentameter convincingly illustrate her preoccupation: how history lives through us, and vice versa, as we become "a pure past that returns to itself unattackable in the framework" of a poem. Though the details of her part-Anglo patrician, part-Irish immigrant heritage discussed in the long preface may seem like pedigree posturing, we slowly realize that for her, every historical figure is fascinating as a "cinder of the lexical drift," a person who now lives only through our reading of them. The genius of poems like "Hinge Picture," entering the terror and eros that created the Bible, and "Secret History of the Dividing Line," which explores the beginnings of exile and nationhood, is in the impulsive and authentic voices (unlike those of Pound's Cantos) given these generative speakers. No nostalgia, wonder or prefab interpretations cloud the immediacy or exquisite lyricism of the better works here. We are struck by "the war-whoop in each dusty narrative." <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Policy State: An American Predicament</h2><p><p>The steady accretion of public policies over the decades has fundamentally changed how America is governed.

Pildes, New York University School of Law</b></p><h2>Doubting: Growing Through the Uncertainties of Faith</h2><p>We live in a culture that doubts everything as a matter of principle. In such an environment, how can even faith be immune to doubt? Can I really trust in the gospel? Does God really love me? Can I really be of any use to God? We are taught to doubt but commanded to believe. Somehow we think that admitting to doubt is tantamount to insulting God. But doubt is not a sign of spiritual weakness--rather it&#39;s an indication of spiritual growing pains. Alister McGrath, no stranger to a faith born of doubt, here offers good news to doubters: your faith can grow, and strengthen as it grows. It needs to take root in your experience of God, it needs to take in the nourishment of instruction in the words and ways of God, it needs to be stretched into greater obedience to the commands and calling of God--but it can grow beyond doubt into a thriving relationship.</p><p><strong>Alister McGrath</strong> is president of the Oxford Center for Christian Apologetics. He is the author of many books, including <em>The Twilight of Atheism, Theology for Amateurs</em> and <em>"I Believe": Exploring the Apostles' Creed.</em>"In this short book, McGrath's pastoral concern for those struggling with doubt is apparent. His words provide encouragement and hope to continue to pursue faith in God in the midst of doubt." (Glenn R. Kreider, Bibliotheca Sacra, October-December 2008)<br><br>"Many Christians experience doubt of their faith in the first years after accepting Christ. This book is for them." (ECIBA.org, February 13, 2008)<br><br>"It's a rare thing to find a theologian altogether thorough, brief, and satisfying. Irish author, theologian, and former atheist Alister McGrath offers a manageable first-read on addressing a new believer's doubts." (Modern Reformation, July/August 2007)<br><br>"McGrath deals intelligently and methodically with the stigmatized subject of doubt, clearly separating it from disbelief." (Church Libraries, Summer 2007)<br><br>"How do we contend with opposing worldviews? How do we deal with uncertainty about such fundamental things as God, Jesus Christ and the Bible? How do we deal with doubt about ourselves? All of these and other questions we struggle with on a daily basis are covered in eleven helpful chapters." (Jim Miller Review, August 13, 2007)<br><br>"McGrath writes in a conversational manner which makes this book accessible to a wide variety of readers. . . . [A]nyone with questions about the veracity of Christianity should benefit from reading this book." (Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith, September 2007)<br><br>"McGrath has a knack for giving us a good bird's eye view of broad ideas. For those of us who have lots of questions about God's perplexing interaction with humanity as well as those of us who are just plain skeptics. <em>Doubting</em> invites us to look deeper and to grow 'through the uncertainties of faith.'"

Historical events are firmly situated in space&#x2015;a task Bunge accomplishes through liberal use of maps and frequent references to recognizable twentieth-century landmarks.</p><p>More than a work of historical geography, <i>Fitzgerald</i> is a political intervention. By 1967 the neighborhood was mostly African American; Black Power was ascendant; and Detroit would experience a major riot. Immersed in the daily life of the area, Bunge encouraged residents to tell their stories and to think about local politics in spatial terms. His desire to undertake a different sort of geography led him to create a work that was nothing like a typical work of social science. The jumble of text, maps, and images makes it a particularly urgent book&#x2015;a major theoretical contribution to urban geography that is also a startling evocation of street-level Detroit during a turbulent era.</p><p>A Sarah Mills Hodge Fund Publication</p></p><p>WILLIAM BUNGE lived in the Fitzgerald neighborhood of Detroit and taught geography at Wayne State University. In 1970 the House Un-American Activities Committee included Bunge&#x2019;s name on a list of sixty-five &#x201c;radical&#x201d; speakers. Blacklisted and unable to find academic work, he fled to Canada, where he taught at several universities and (like the founder of critical geography, Henri Lefebvre) drove a cab. He is the author of three other books.<p>The reissuing of this classic text in urban geography will excite old students and new. Bunge and his teams soldiered on to overcome countless challenges: social norms, racialized political divides, recalcitrant institutions, and a violent state. More than thirty years after its initial publication, and with the addition of an insightful introductory essay, Fitzgerald will continue to influence geographers. We must not lose sight of the conviction and hope of radical possibilities in American cities set forth by Bunge and his geographical expeditions.</p> (Alison Mountz <i>author of <i>Seeking Asylum: Human Smuggling and Bureaucracy at the Border</i></i>)<br><br><p>There&#x2019;s nobody like Bill Bunge and there&#x2019;ll never be anyone like him again. <i>Fitzgerald</i> is another way of telling a story about city life, about its horrors and threats, its joys and possibilities. Our cities continue to crumble, disintegrate financially and socially; yet geographers fret about tenure reviews and research evaluations. How can we not feel shame reading Bunge&#x2019;s great book today? He&#x2019;s our conscience, he gnaws away inside us, always forcing us to consider who we are as scholars and what we should do to save life on planet urban.</p> (Andy Merrifield <i>author of <i>Henri Lefebvre: A Critical Introduction</i></i>)</p><h2>The Library of Alexandria</h2><p>The Library of Alexandria was the largest library of its time and a major center for learning and scholarly research, particularly in the fields of astronomy, geography, mathematics, and medicine. Caesar and Cleopatra, Erastosthenes and Euclid, Archimedes and Alexander the Great are just a few of the famous people connected to its story. Today, historians still argue about how the library was destroyed, and no one knows exactly what it looked like, yet there is no question that the library continues to fascinate and intrigue us. This extensively researched look at what we do know about the Library of Alexandria features Kelly Trumble&#x2019;s short, accessible chapters, and richly detailed full-color paintings by Robina MacIntyre Marshall. Together, they tell the story of one of the wonders of the ancient world, and show how its influence as continued long after its destruction. Glossary, suggested reading, selected bibliography, index.<br></p><p>Kelly Trumble is the author of <i>Cat Mummies</i> and <i>The Library of Alexandria.</i> She lives in Kirkland, Washington, where she has studied library technology, volunteers at an animal shelter, and is finally learning to play the piano.Grade 5-9-In this well-organized and thorough resource, Trumble delves into the people, legends, and politics surrounding the creation and ruin of the largest library in the ancient world. The chapter on collecting books details its methods of acquisition, which ranged from payment to thievery. A section on Alexandria's competitor, Pergamum, located in Asia Minor, provides an opportunity to describe and contrast the use of parchment and papyrus. Much attention is paid to the scholars who utilized the library and their achievements. For example, Eratosthenes calculated the circumference of the Earth. Herophilus practiced dissection and probably vivisection, adding much to contemporary understanding of the function of human organs and systems. Back matter includes maps, the Ptolemy family tree, and a description of sites in ancient Alexandria. The full-color, single-page illustrations, rendered in watercolor and gouache, are uneven. Marshall is more successful at depicting the flow of fabric, architectural ornamentation, and inanimate objects than in capturing the proportions and physicality of the human body. The modern-day Bibliotheca Alexandrina, an institution inspired by its ancient predecessor, is given only a brief mention. These flaws notwithstanding, this book is a unique and timely celebration of the age-old passion for and preservation of ideas.<br><i>Wendy Lukehart, Washington DC Public Library</i><br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

These characters inhabit an amoral universe where beauty reflects no truth and love is an empty delusion. Each character is ultimately annihilated by their own obsessions.<br><br>Acclaimed and reviled when it exploded on the Quebec literary scene in 1959, <i>Mad Shadows</i> initiated a new era in Quebec fiction.</p><p>Marie-Claire Blais was born in Quebec City in 1939. Blais&#x2019; first novel, <b>Mad Shadows</b> (1959), amounted to a literary revolution in Quebec. The book ushered in a new era in Quebec fiction with its nightmarish depiction of the obsessions and evils of society. Her writings, which have won international acclaim, have been translated into 13 languages.<b>One</b><br><br>The<br>train<br>was<br>leaving<br>town.<br>Lying back with his head against his mother&#x2019;s shoulder, Patrice followed the dappled countryside with a melancholy expression. Behind his forehead everything grew confused, like a billowing stormcloud on a screen. He watched in silence and did not understand, but his idiot face was so dazzling that it made one think of genius. His mother caressed the nape of his neck with the palm of her hand. With a gentle slip of her all-too-supple wrist she could lower Patrice&#x2019;s head to her bosom and hear his breathing more easily.<br><br>On the other side, aloof and motionless, her daughter Isabelle-Marie sat pressing her sharp features against the window. Louise often said to herself, &#x201c;Isabelle-Marie never really had the face of a child . . . But Patrice . . . Oh, Patrice!&#x201d;<br><br>Isabelle-Marie was thirteen. She was tall and emaciated; her alarming eyes, so often full of anger, seemed glued to black bone. When she scowled, the lower part of her face twisted into a look of fierce contempt. It was almost frightening.<br><br>Her mother Louise, who was rich and owned many farms, gave her daughter all the most menial chores in order to devote her life and her remaining youth to Patrice. One could see that Louise believed in herself and above all, to the point of obsession, in the beauty of Patrice.<br><br>In the seats nearby, the passengers were looking at her son. Weary of having nothing to think about, the child yielded to sleep, gently, with a drop of perspiration on his brow. Louise wiped the drop away with the tip of her finger and smiled with pride at the thought that the beauty of her son was becoming ever more devastating, to even the coldest onlooker.<br><br>&#x201c;Patrice . . . such a magnificent child!&#x201d;<br><br>At the same moment, Isabelle-Marie thought, Patrice, the Idiot!<br><br>Patrice did not seem to worry about himself. He pressed even closer to his mother, his large green eyes empty as the night. Now and then his eyelashes and his cheeks would tremble, suddenly, and not in unison. His forehead was white, intact, and soft as the thigh of a swan. His bare lips curved without the slightest trace of tension. Never was there a sign of life on these lips. The lips of a corpse. Isabelle-Marie cast a sly look at him.<br><br>&#x201c;A Beautiful Beast!&#x201d; she muttered between her teeth.<br><br>Louise did not question the intelligence of her ten-year-old Adonis. He spoke very little, but she attributed this speechlessness, like the silence of the gods, to unconcern.<br><br>His extraordinary beauty satisfied her every wish. Nevertheless, Patrice was an idiot. Isabelle-Marie knew that behind his pale forehead was the deep stupor of an inactive mind, the lethargy of a dead brain. How cold it must be beneath his skin, she thought and was ashamed to see him sleeping peacefully, protected by his mother&#x2019;s shoulder. She knew that the woman&#x2019;s eyes, indeed her whole being, rested on this solitary and fragile beauty.<br><br>The passengers never stopped looking at Patrice. Isabelle-Marie began to blush. She felt sick to her stomach. Soon she saw nothing outside the window. A strange desire to die came over her. She rose and pressed against the cold glass. Her bruised cheek shivered. In an awkward attempt to hide her trembling, Isabelle-Marie clawed at the pane with her nails, trying to hold onto it . . . Louise did not see her. Louise never really dared look at her. Finally Isabelle-Marie buried her face in her hands.<br><br>&#x201c;Mother, I have a fever.&#x201d;<br><br>Bewildered, physically terrified by the people around her, she heard a woman cry out, &#x201c;What a handsome son you have!&#x201d;<br><br>And Louise, in her contented voice, answered, &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t he, though?&#x201d;<br><br>Isabelle-Marie fainted.<br><br>When she opened her eyes, they were drawing into the station. The other passengers, she was relieved to discover, had forgotten about the beauty of her brother. They walked hurriedly toward the station, paying no attention to one another. Isabelle-Marie began to breathe again. Blood warmed her legs and she felt a sense of release, a crazy desire to burst out laughing now that the torture had ceased.<br><br>&#x201c;What is it, Isabelle-Marie?&#x201d; asked Louise in a deceitful tone of voice.<br><br>&#x201c;Nothing at all, Mother. Only a slight dizziness . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Louise held her son&#x2019;s hand nested in her own and the two of them slipped through the crowd, oblivious of the smoke that filled the air. The blond child followed indolently, his head resting against his mother&#x2019;s elbow. Isabelle-Marie was sorry that the sun cast such an aura of innocence over Patrice&#x2019;s hair. She followed her brother, awkward in her black dress . . . and more awkward still in the flesh.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><h2>Apparition Island (The Windjammer Mystery Series)</h2><p><p>A chilling tale of murder unfolds during a fierce September hurricane on the Maine coast in this haunting story of two deaths mysteriously bound together by the long reach of time.</p> <p>As Hurricane Ivan bears down on the coast, the crew of the <i>Maine Wind</i> retrieves the body of a young woman from the sea.

Chief Dr. David Spier must keep the emergency room running smoothly and efficiently, even as his terrified co-workers wonder who will be the next victim. But when the monster himself is dragged into the E.R. in handcuffs -- hideously burned, suffering, and begging for mercy -- the nightmare is far from over ... it has only just begun. A single act of humanity is about to unleash a bloody wave of horror that threatens to engulf everyone and everything Dr. Spier cares about. His most sacred oath as a healer has become a death sentence -- for David Spier ... and for a city under siege.</p></p><p>Division chief of emergency services at UCLA hospital, David Spier is just as horrified as his colleagues when a madman wielding a beaker of drain cleaner attacks an ER nurse who happens to be the sister of an LAPD cop.

The sun was high, the temperature well over a hundred degrees, and breathing through the embroidered cotton scarf made it even more stifling. But the wind had just kicked up, and there was a lot of playa dust&#x2014;fine gypsum sand, deceptively soft and powdery, but alkali enough to make your eyes burn and your skin crack&#x2014;and after two days in the desert, I had learned that it was better to be hot than to choke.<br>Pretty much everyone was holding a camera of some kind&#x2014;mostly phones, of course, but also big SLRs and even old-fashioned film cameras, including a genuine antique plate camera whose operator hid out from the dust under a huge black cloth that made me hot just to look at it. Everything was ruggedized for the fine, blowing dust, mostly through the simple expedient of sticking it in a ziplock bag, which is what I&#x2019;d done with my phone. I turned around slowly to get a panorama and saw that the man walking past me was holding the string for a gigantic helium balloon a hundred yards overhead, from which dangled a digital video camera. Also, the man holding the balloon was naked.<br>Well, not entirely. He was wearing shoes. I understood that: playa dust is hard on your feet. They call it playa-foot, when the alkali dust dries out your skin so much that it starts to crack and peel. Everyone agrees that playa-foot sucks.<br>Burning Man is a festival held every Labor Day weekend in the middle of Nevada&#x2019;s Black Rock Desert. Fifty thousand people show up in this incredibly harsh, hot, dusty environment and build a huge city&#x2014;Black Rock City&#x2014;and <i>participate</i>. &#x201c;Spectator&#x201d; is a vicious insult in Black Rock City. Everyone&#x2019;s supposed to be <i>doing</i> stuff and, yeah, also admiring everyone else&#x2019;s stuff (hence all the cameras). At Burning Man, everyone is the show.<br>I wasn&#x2019;t naked, but the parts of me that were showing <i>were</i> decorated with elaborate mandalas laid on with colored zinc. A lady as old as my mother, wearing a tie-dyed wedding dress, had offered to paint me that morning, and she&#x2019;d done a great job. That&#x2019;s another thing about Burning Man: it runs on a gift economy, which means that you generally go around offering nice things to strangers a lot, which makes for a surprisingly pleasant environment. The designs the painter had laid down made me look <i>amazing,</i> and there were plenty of cameras aiming my way as I ambled across the open desert toward Nine O&#x2019;Clock.<br>Black Rock City is a pretty modern city: it has public sanitation (portable chem-toilets decorated with raunchy poems reminding you not to put anything but toilet paper in them), electricity and Internet service (at Six O&#x2019;Clock, the main plaza in the middle of the ring-shaped city), something like a government (the nonprofit that runs Burning Man), several local newspapers (all of them doing better than the newspapers in the real world!), a dozen radio stations, an all-volunteer police force (the Black Rock Rangers, who patrolled wearing tutus or parts of chicken suits or glitter paint), and many other amenities associated with the modern world.<br>But BRC has no official surveillance. There are no CCTVs, no checkpoints&#x2014;at least not after the main gate, where tickets are collected&#x2014;no ID checks at all, no bag searches, no RFID sniffers, no mobile phone companies logging your movements. There was also no mobile phone service. No one drives&#x2014;except for the weird art cars registered with the Department of Mutant Vehicles&#x2014;so there were no license plate cameras and no sniffers for your E-ZPasses. The WiFi was open and unlogged. Attendees at Burning Man agreed not to use their photos commercially without permission, and it was generally considered polite to ask people before taking their portraits.<br>So there I was, having my picture taken through the blowing dust as I gulped down water from the water jug I kept clipped to my belt at all times, sucking at the stubby built-in straw under cover of the blue-and-silver burnoose, simultaneously observed and observer, simultaneously observed and unsurveilled, and it was <i>glorious</i>.<br>&#x201c;Wahoo!&#x201d; I shouted to the dust and the art cars and the naked people and the enormous wooden splay-armed effigy perched atop a pyramid straight ahead of me in the middle of the desert. This was The Man, and we&#x2019;d burn him in three nights, and that&#x2019;s why it was called Burning Man. I couldn&#x2019;t wait.<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re in a good mood,&#x201d; a jawa said from behind me. Even with the tone-shifter built into its dust mask, the cloaked sand-person had an awfully familiar voice.<br>&#x201c;Ange?&#x201d; I said. We&#x2019;d been missing each other all that day, ever since I&#x2019;d woken up an hour before her and snuck out of the tent to catch the sunrise (which was <i>awesome</i>), and we&#x2019;d been leaving each other notes back at camp all day about where we were heading next. Ange had spent the summer spinning up the jawa robes, working with cooling towels that trapped sweat as it evaporated, channeling it back over her skin for extra evaporative cooling. She&#x2019;d hand-dyed it a mottled brown, tailored it into the characteristic monkish robe shape, and added crossed bandoliers. These exaggerated her breasts, which made the whole thing entirely and totally <i>warsome</i>. She hadn&#x2019;t worn it out in public yet, and now, in the dust and the glare, she was undoubtedly the greatest sand-person I&#x2019;d ever met. I hugged her and she hugged me back so hard it knocked the wind out of me, one of her trademarked wrestling-hold cuddles.<br>&#x201c;I smudged your paint,&#x201d; she said through the voice-shifter after we unclinched.<br>&#x201c;I got zinc on your robes,&#x201d; I said.<br>She shrugged. &#x201c;Like it matters! We both look fabulous. Now, what have you seen and what have you done and where have you been, young man?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Where to start?&#x201d; I said. I&#x2019;d been wandering up and down the radial avenues that cut through the city, lined with big camps sporting odd exhibits&#x2014;one camp where a line of people were efficiently making snow cones for anyone who wanted them, working with huge blocks of ice and a vicious ice-shaver. Then a camp where someone had set up a tall, linoleum-covered slide that you could toboggan down on a plastic magic carpet, after first dumping a gallon of waste water over the lino to make it plenty slippery.

Leonard Feather, writing in <em>The Los Angeles Times</em>, said "no other writer now living can write with comparable grace and equal enthusiasm about everyone from Jack Teagarden and Art Tatum to Cecil Taylor and Ornette Coleman." And Bruce Cook in <em>The New Leader</em> called the book "the quintessential Whitney Balliett, the cream of the cream, a collection that leaves no doubt about his strength."<br> Now greatly expanded with sixteen new essays, <em>American Musicians II</em> remains a superb introduction to the giants of jazz, or as Balliett himself calls it, "a highly personal encyclopedia, a series of close accounts of how a beautiful music grew, flourished, and (possibly) began the long trek back to its native silences." Breathtaking in its scope, the book features Balliett's singular portraits of jazz greats who have shaped this uniquely American tradition from its earliest days to the present, from inimitable innovators like Joe "King" Oliver and Jelly Roll Morton, to swing-era mainstays Fats Waller and Lester Young, to avant-garde pioneers such as Cecil Taylor and Ornette Coleman. We are treated to profiles of Pee Wee Russell, Red Allen, Earl Hines, and Mary Lou Williams, written when they were at the height of their powers; reconstructions of the lives of Art Tatum, Coleman Hawkins, Jack Teagarden, Zoot Sims, and Dave Tough; quick but indelible glimpses into the daily (or nocturnal) lives of Duke Ellington and Charles Mingus; and vivid portrayals of such modern masters as Red Norvo, Buddy Rich, Elvin Jones, Art Farmer, Michael Moore, and Tommy Flanagan. This new edition adds essays on such major musicians as Benny Goodman, Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, George Shearing, and Paul Desmond.<br> In the forty years that he has written for <em>The New Yorker</em>, Whitney Balliett has earned the reputation as America's foremost jazz critic. The late Philip Larkin described him as a "writer who brings jazz journalism to the verge of poetry." Alistair Cook wrote that he is, "without a rival in sight, the most literate and knowledgeable living writer on jazz." And Gene Lees called him "one of the most graceful essayists in the English language on <em>any</em> subject." Now, with the second edition of <em>American Musicians</em> in hand, music lovers can experience Balliett's peerless observations on the jazz scene, as he takes you into the hearts and minds of jazz's great practitioners.</p><p>An earlier version of <b>American Musicians</b> appeared in 1986. Now the author has added 17 essays to the collection, and the result is a highly personal encyclopedia of jazz history, written with Whitney Balliett's trademark lyricism. Few critics can describe a piece of music with this kind of delicacy and precision. And the comments that Balliett elicits from his subjects are themselves worth the price of admission. Here, for example, pianist John Lewis goes right to the heart of jazz improvisation, and gives us a hint of what lays behind it: "When I take a solo, I try not to look at my fingers. It distracts me from music-making . . . I think about other things, even other music. If you break through those mere rules, destroy them, that's good, and it can become quite a marvelous experience. It's not just sadness or joy, it's something beyond that, perhaps exhilaration, but that's rare."<br><em>About the Author:</em><br> <strong>Whitney Balliett</strong> has been <em>The New Yorker's</em> jazz critic for nearly forty years.<br></p><h2>Caliban</h2><p>Before his death in 1992, Isaac Asimov conceived the next step in robot evolution: Caliban. In a universe protected by the Three Laws of Robotics, humans are safe. Robots are bound by law to care for and to obey them. But when an experiment with a new type of robot goes awry, Caliban is created. He is without guilt or conscience--and he has no knowledge of or compassion for humanity.</p><p>Isaac Asimov authored over 400 books in a career that lasted nearly 50 years. As a leading scientific writer, historian, and futurist, he covered a variety of subjects ranging from mathematics to humor, and won numerous awards for his work.Allen ( Ring of Charon ), with the imprimatur of the late SF legend, offers here a reflection on what would happen if robots did not follow Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics. Those Laws build into robots a code of behavior through which they cannot harm humans. Here, the world of Inferno has become so dependent on robotic servants that humans have lost even the motivation to save their planet from impending ecological collapse. When a leading robotics scientist is mysteriously attacked and her experimental, lawless robot Caliban is let loose on the planet, the sheltered world of the Infernals is destined never to be the same. Political intrigue, love triangles, some smart detective work and Caliban's search for a robotic identity beyond being a servant to humans keep the story always interesting as it wends its way to an exciting conclusion. Unfortunately, Allen misses many opportunities to delve into how robots, programmed not to harm humans, can allow the long-term safety of their masters to be put in jeopardy through robotic dependence. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Thinking Maps : A Language for Learning</h2><p>Thinking Maps training/resource manual for all teachers in grades K-12 that includes wall poster set Provides all teachers with a specific methodology for introducing, teaching, transferring, integrating and assessing Thinking Maps common visual language Contains relevant, teacher-friendly classroom application ideas with chapters that focus on Literacy Links, Content Connections, and Instructional Strategies Emphasizes Thinking Maps for differentiation and academic rigor</p><p></p><h2>A Last Kiss for Mummy: A teenage mum, a tiny infant, a desperate decision</h2><p><p>Bestselling author and foster carer Casey Watson tells the heartbreaking true story of a teenage mother and baby in need of a safe and loving home.</p><p>At fourteen, Emma is just a child herself &#x2013; and one who&#x2019;s never been properly mothered.

That would never have been my choice of words.<br> <br>Of course, when I looked again across the glove counter or perfume display, it was never her, just another dark-haired woman trying to make the best of herself. But each of these imagined glimpses left a piece of scar tissue across my heart. I told myself to stop thinking of her&#x2014;I would simply pretend the situation did not exist&#x2014;but then I caught sight of another pale-faced brunette and the dull ache in my chest would flare up again and leave me feeling nauseous.<br> <br>When I had first fallen in love with Archie, I had likened the feeling to a white dove trying to escape from my chest. Now that Archie&#x2019;s head had been turned by this creature, I imagined the dove being strangled with a necklace of barbed wire and slowly rotting away inside me.<br> <br>The distant sound of a brass band playing carols lightened my mood for a moment. I had always adored Christmas and I was determined that this year was going to seem just as festive and jolly as normal, at least for Rosalind&#x2019;s sake.<br> <br>I walked over to the doll counter and a bank of china-white faces with blank blue eyes stared back at me. I picked up a doll with straw-yellow hair and ran my fingers down its smooth pale cheek. How funny that I had named my own daughter after my childhood doll, a toy that I had admired but rarely played with. Even then I had preferred to make up my own stories. Rosalind had not inherited my imagination, which was probably for the best, as sometimes my fancy, although it had its benefits, left me feeling wrung out and close to wretched.<br> <br>As I put the doll back down on the counter and was about to pick up its black-haired twin with eyes like plump blackberries, I felt a pricking at the base of my skull. The hairs on the back of my neck bristled and a shiver went through me. I turned round, certain that someone was studying me, but met only the kindly eyes of elderly ladies dressed in their smart tweeds. I comforted myself with the knowledge that the Army &amp; Navy Stores in Victoria was the kind of place where nothing dreadful could ever happen.<br> <br>I had been coming here since I was a girl, when Granny B. would take me shopping to buy lengths of ribbon and bags of buttons. Afterwards, my grandmother would always treat me to a delicious strawberry ice. And yet now, there was something terribly wrong. The feeling of dread was physical. My mouth was dry and my throat tightened. My breathing had quickened. I raised my hand to my neck to try to loosen the collar of my blouse, but that didn&#x2019;t help. I still felt as though someone was watching me and they wanted to do me harm.<br> <br>When I was a small girl I had suffered from nightmares in which the character of a gunman had appeared to me. He had looked, so I had told my mother and sister, Madge, like a French soldier carrying a musket. But it had not been the sight of the gun that had frightened me. Rather, there had been something else that had disturbed me, something about his nature, his character. He was a personification of evil, a force I knew even then was only too real. Sometimes, I would have dreams in which I would be sitting at the dining table at Ashfield, the family house in Torquay, and I would look up to see that his spirit had stolen into the body of my dear mother or Madge. Now I could almost feel the Gunman&#x2019;s hot, sour breath on the back of my neck.<br> <br>I gathered my things together and, with the kind of slow, deliberate pace of a cat sensing the approach of danger, walked towards the exit onto Victoria Street. The sharp slap of the cold December air came as something of a relief. I had to stop myself from looking around nervously. My hands were trembling, my mouth still dry.<br> <br>Surely the sense of danger I had felt in the Stores and on the street could not have been merely a product of my imagination. Yet I felt my cheeks redden as I remembered the incident of the check. I had been down at Ashfield, clearing out the house after my mother&#x2019;s death. What with the ten- or eleven-hour days, the boxes full of family mementos, the moth-eaten clothes, the piles of Grannie&#x2019;s dresses, and the crowd of memories from my childhood that threatened to transport me back to the past, I must have lost my senses for a moment. I had been asked to write a check and I had signed not my own name but that of Blanche Amory, a character from a Thackeray novel. What had come over me? Was the same thing happening to me now? Was I losing touch with reality? It was a terrifying feeling.<br> <br>I tried to take a couple of deep breaths, but my chest felt tight. I could not shake off the sense that at any moment something awful would happen. I wanted to rush back to the safety and comforts of the Forum, my club on Hyde Park Corner. But I didn&#x2019;t want the Gunman to follow me there. With a deliberately slow pace I set off down Victoria Street in the direction of the Underground. As I approached the entrance to the station, the crowd began to swell. Even though my legs felt as though they might give way at any moment, fear propelled me forwards. Luckily, the station was busy and I disappeared among the throng. I pushed my way through the crowd, looking around as I did so. I bought myself a ticket and descended into the dark bowels of London. I felt sure I had shaken off whoever it was who had been following me. As I breathed in the sooty air I felt, for a moment, happy and safe again.<br> <br>Some of my smart Sunningdale friends always thought it was rather quaint that I loved traveling on the Underground. But it was such a rich source of material: all those intriguing faces, those curious characters, not to mention the delicious possibilities it presented when it came to plot. The Man in the Brown Suit was a perfect example. It was a bit of a silly story, but it had proved popular with the readers, no doubt because of its dramatic opening that I had chosen to set on the platform at Hyde Park Corner.<br> <br>That had been such a fun novel to write, and I had dashed it off relatively quickly, not like the turgid stuff I had been churning out lately. Perhaps I needed a holiday. I hoped the short break in Beverley would do me&#x2014;do both of us&#x2014;a world of good. I certainly wasn&#x2019;t a subscriber to the theory that unhappiness bred creativity. This last year had been the most miserable of my life and look what I had produced: the Frankenstein&#x2019;s monster that was The Big Four, a novel that had been stitched together from a series of short stories, and a few lackluster scenes for a book, The Mystery of the Blue Train, that would not flow.<br> <br>A blast of hot air signaled the imminent arrival of the train. I grasped my hat and stepped closer to the edge of the platform so I could have a better chance of securing a seat. Another step and I could easily lose my balance and fall onto the tracks. Everything, all the pain that I had suffered over the course of the year, would come to an end. Archie would be free to marry, there would be none of the shame that always came with a divorce, and Rosalind would learn to love her new mother. What was it my daughter had said to me? &#x201c;I know Daddy likes me and would like to be with me. It&#x2019;s you he doesn&#x2019;t seem to like.&#x201d; Only a child, in all her innocence, could utter such a thing. And yet while this was an accurate description of the state of our marriage, the observation had felt like another dagger to the heart.<br> <br>As the train emerged from the blackness and started to hurtle towards us, I took a step back. The noise of the engine vibrated in my ears, deafening me for a moment. Just then, I felt a light touch on the base of my spine. I turned to look round, but in that split second, the pressure on my back intensified. I felt myself being shunted, pushed forwards towards the tracks. I opened my mouth to scream, but my throat had turned to sandpaper.<br> <br>My hands reached out at awkward angles in a bid to hold on to something, anything, but I clasped at nothing but hot air. I could feel the skin on my cheeks begin to burn from a ferocious all-consuming heat that seemed to be sucking the liquid from my eyes. Just as I was tipping forwards, my head lolling like the doll&#x2019;s I had handled in the Stores, I felt an almighty wrench pull me back, a strength that I had hardly thought possible. I gasped at the force of it. It was then I felt myself melting away as I fainted and collapsed onto the platform.<br> <br>I became aware of someone breathing into my ear. At first, I thought I was in bed, with Rosalind beside me. But then I became aware of a sourness, an unpleasant ferric odor that forced me to open my eyes. I woke up to a world of fragments and disjointed faces.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m a doctor, stand clear, please stand clear,&#x201d; a voice said.<br> <br>I tried to speak, but could not. Again, there was that foul stream of air on my face. I felt someone cradling my head. The touch was soft and delicate, but my body, instead of relaxing, began to tense up. I attempted to sit, but the long fingers with their silky touch eased me back down again.<br> <br>&#x201c;Now, now, lie there for a moment or two. You nearly had a nasty accident. It seems that you fainted just as the train was approaching.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, I felt someone&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, you felt someone pull you back. That was me. I&#x2019;m a doctor.&#x201d;<br> <br>Although the words should have been comforting, for some reason they sent a chill through me.<br> <br>&#x201c;Thank you, that&#x2019;s very kind. But I&#x2019;m feeling much better now. If you could just let me get on my way I would be most grateful.&#x201d;<br> <br>The people who had gathered around me had started to disperse now that they thought they understood the situation: a lady had fainted, a doctor who had behaved like a hero was in attendance and had stopped her from falling onto the tracks.<br> <br>&#x201c;I think it would be wise if you took a couple of deep breaths,&#x201d; he said, before leaning towards me. The stench of his metallic breath forced me to take out my handkerchief and place it over my nose.<br> <br>&#x201c;Now listen to me very carefully,&#x201d; he said in a whisper. &#x201c;I think I have something to say to you that you will very much want to hear.&#x201d;<br> <br>At the moment I removed my handkerchief from my mouth, again in a voice only I could hear, he said, &#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t scream if I were you. Unless you want the whole world to learn about your husband and his mistress.&#x201d;<br> <br>I couldn&#x2019;t take in what he was saying. What did he know of Archie and that woman?<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, I thought that would get your interest. Now, what I suggest is that you let me help you up and we can go and have a cup of tea.&#x201d;<br> <br>I felt the spiderlike touch of his fingers begin to encircle my wrist.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sweet tea, that&#x2019;s what I would prescribe,&#x201d; he said in a louder voice. &#x201c;Wouldn&#x2019;t you agree? That&#x2019;s the best thing for shock.&#x201d;<br> <br>I did not know what to do. Should I make a dash for it? Obviously the man had some information that he thought he could use against me, against us. No doubt he was a dirty little blackmailer, keen to extort money from me. How was he to know that our resources were stretched? On the face of it, it looked as though we lived a gilded existence. Yes, I had written six novels, and a collection of Poirot stories, but the earnings had not been that high because of the awful contract with my first publisher, The Bodley Head, which had tied me to five books on a low royalty rate. Thank goodness my agent had managed to extract me from that. In addition, the house cost a fortune to run and there had been a great many unforeseen expenses.<br> <br>I could refuse point-blank, but what if he took his nasty story to the newspapers? That would destroy Archie, I knew. Even after everything Archie had told me, I still loved him and I would do anything in my power to protect him.<br> <br>&#x201c;I know a nice little caf� just around the corner,&#x201d; he said, pressing my wrist with his fingers. &#x201c;Shall I help you stand?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I think I can manage by myself, thank you,&#x201d; I said, easing myself up off the ground. I brushed my skirt of the dust and grime, quickly adjusted my hat, and assessed the man standing in front of me. The first thing I noticed was the contrast between his creamy pale skin and his black beard. He had eyes the shade of blackberries and full, fleshy lips the color of blood. He was of medium height, nicely dressed, and seemingly well-educated, not your typical grubby blackmailer.<br> <br>As we walked out of the Underground and back down Victoria Street, unperceptive strangers might have assumed that we were a married couple. But if those passersby had taken the trouble to look into my face, I&#x2019;m sure they would have seen the uncertainty and anxiety in my eyes.<br> <br>&#x201c;What is it that you want?&#x201d; I asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s wait until we are settled with a cup of tea,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;That way it will be much more civilized.&#x201d;<br> <br>I searched the street for a policeman, but there were none to be found. But perhaps it would be better if I dealt with this myself.<br> <br>&#x201c;First of all, I must congratulate you on the success of The Murder of Roger Ackroyd,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Absolutely first rate. How you pulled it off, it&#x2019;s really quite extraordinary. I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;ve had a great number of people tell you so, but you can add my name to your growing list of admirers. You must have quite a mind inside that pretty head of yours.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Surely the last thing you want to do is talk about books,&#x201d; I said stiffly as we walked into the caf� and sat down at a table some distance from the other customers.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, but it is. But first let me introduce myself. My name is Patrick Kurs. I&#x2019;m a general practitioner from Rickmansworth. I have a small practice, mostly full of neurotic wives and husbands who drink too much. I suppose you could draw a parallel between Dr. James Sheppard in Roger Ackroyd and me. Quite a fascinating character. You see, Mrs. Christie, I believe you and I are remarkably similar in many ways.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure what you mean,&#x201d; I said, before a girl in a black-and-white uniform came to our table to take our order. Dr. Kurs ordered a pot of tea for two.<br> <br>&#x201c;As I was saying, I have made a great study of your work, Mrs. Christie, and I am certain that you have a first-class criminal mind. You seem to know how a murderer&#x2019;s brain works. It&#x2019;s almost as if you have some kind of inner knowledge of how a killer feels. It&#x2019;s most uncanny.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; I said, before I realized that what the doctor was saying was, in most people&#x2019;s eyes, far from a compliment. &#x201c;I mean&#x2014;yes, that may be so, but what has this got to do with my husband? I would much rather you address the business at hand.&#x201d;<br> <br>When the girl returned with our tea, we fell into silence, but as soon as she retreated Dr. Kurs shifted in his seat and cleared his throat.<br> <br>&#x201c;Very well,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You see, it&#x2019;s come to my attention that your husband has been having a&#x2014;how shall I put this?&#x2014;an intimate relationship with another woman. That&#x2019;s correct, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;<br> <br>I simply nodded my head, but I could feel my eyes blaze with hatred.<br> <br>&#x201c;You would rather this fact and the details be kept out of the newspapers?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So it is money. That&#x2019;s what you want?&#x201d;<br> <br>Dr. Kurs blinked and looked slightly taken aback. &#x201c;No, not at all,&#x201d; he said, laughing. &#x201c;I think you&#x2019;ve underestimated me, Mrs. Christie. What I propose is something far more than mere financial gain. I have, I suppose one could describe it, a certain scheme for you. You may think it unconvent...</p><h2>Body Toxic: An Environmental Memoir</h2><p>Two immigrant families drawn together from wildly different parts of the world, Italy on one side and Barbados on the other, pursued their vision of the American dream by building a summer escape in the boglands of New Jersey, where the rural and industrial collide. They picked gooseberries on hot afternoons and spent lazy days rowing dinghies down creeks. But the gooseberry patch was near a nuclear power plant that released record levels of radiation, and the creeks were invisibly ruined by illegally dumped toxic waste. One by one, family members found their bodies mirroring the compromised landscape of the Barrens: infertile and damaged by inexplicable growths. Soon the area parents were being asked to donate their children&#39;s baby teeth to be tested for radiation.</p><p>Susanne Antonetta writes with a poet's precision about the almost unspeakable series of ills that have assaulted her body: cysts on her ovaries, a divided uterus, endometriosis, rampant thyroid tumors, a quadruplet pregnancy (no fertility drugs involved) that ended in miscarriage, and manic-depressive illness treated with the wrong drugs until she was in her 30s. There's not a trace of self-pity as she lists the toxic substances leaked into the air, ground, and water by the chemical company, nuclear power plant, and nuclear missile bunker near her family's summer home in Holly Park, New Jersey. She passes over the gruesome inappropriateness of that bucolic name just as she unblinkingly repeats the brutally frank comments of her relatives, who adored her brother and male cousin, had no interest in the four girl children, and excommunicated any family member who violated their rigid rules. "In the end, I'm grateful," she writes of her extended family. "They have given me the gift of clarity. They've released me. There may be nothing kinder you can do than withhold your love." Clarity is among the principal virtues of Antonetta's unusual work, aptly subtitled <i>An Environmental Memoir</i>. She makes general facts personally meaningful by intertwining a historical account of post-World War II America's love affair with heavy industry and its deadly by-products with the specific details of ailments suffered by herself and the other kids who ran down the streets after the DDT-spraying trucks and drank water "full of good iron, good lead, mercury, cadmium, tritium, alpha radiation, good benzenes, PCBs, chlordane, vinyl chloride, lime, mercury, good cyanide." Her scathing but matter-of-fact tone gives the author greater authority as a prophet of the whirlwind we are reaping from careless contamination of our natural resources. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>Susanne Antonetta lives near Seattle with her husband and her young son.</p><h2>Confessions to My Mother</h2><p>For years, Cathy and her mother have been working out their relationship on the comic pages in such an honest, relatable, humor-filled way that thousands of mothers and daughters have written to say the comic strip is the single thing that has helped them keep speaking to each other over the years. <br><br>In <i>Confessions to My Mother</i>, Cathy helps daughters speak to their mothers in an even more poignant way--with page after page of everything from embarrassing truths...<br><br>"The last time you came to visit I spent a whole day hiding things before you got here."<br><br>to belated admissions...<br><br>I'm sorry for the 10 to 15 years I spent grunting at you."<br><br>to personal revelations...<br><br>The inside of my bathroom cabinet looks exactly as bad as the inside of your bathroom cabinet."<br><br>and heartfelt sentiments..<br><br>"When I make your chicken soup, it doesn't taste like your chicken soup."<br><br>"The thing I am the most sure of in my life is that you love me."<br><br>"Because of you, I can't throw out a cardboard box."<br><br>According to creator Cathy Guisewite, <i>Confessions to My Mother</i> is "all the deep, insightful, meaningful things I want to say to Mom, but never actually say because I'm too busy acting like a five-year-old when I'm with her."</p><p>Cathy Guisewite launched <i>Cathy</i> in newspapers in 1976, becoming one of the few female cartoonists to hit the daily strip Big Time.

By focusing on the period s fascination with biology, they compare two impacted areas: the arts, where the idea of metamorphosis produced an aesthetic revival; and politics, where the struggle to bring about a eugenic and racist renewal had unprecedented consequences for society. Highlighting the enormous stylistic diversity and sociopolitical complexity of the times, this thematically-driven publication takes the form of a story in nine episodes. The complexity is reflected in the works of the artists who dealt with dramatic upheavals according to their personal convictions, fears, hopes or disappointments.

That millennials and Generation Z are unfamiliar with his name makes this biography&#x2015;the first of this Renaissance man&#x2015;all the more vital, as science becomes ripped apart by political divisiveness and the need for a unifying message calls out for a voice. Listen to Dr. Bronowski and read this book.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x2015;Michael Shermer, publisher of Skeptic magazine, monthly columnist for Scientific American, Presidential Fellow at Chapman University, and author of Heavens on Earth, The Moral Arc, and The Believing Brain&#x201c;A poet, a mathematician, a historian, and, most of all, a moral philosopher, Jacob Bronowski was a spellbinding speaker on radio and television. Listening to him was like sitting at the feet of a twentieth-century Socrates. His profound thoughts on the human condition are as relevant today as they were fifty years ago, and Timothy Sandefur has done us a great service by writing this book.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x2015;Basil Mahon, author of The Forgotten Genius of Oliver Heaviside and coauthor of Faraday, Maxwell, and the Electromagnetic Field&nbsp;&#x201c;Before Tyson, before Gould, before Sagan, there was Jacob Bronowski. He was a major force for opening the minds of citizens to the importance and wonder of science, as perhaps only a Renaissance man, a poet-turned-mathematician, could be.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x2015;Stanley A. Rice, professor, Southeastern Oklahoma State University, and author of&nbsp;Scientifically Thinking: How to Liberate Your Mind, Solve the World's Problems, and Embrace the Beauty of Science&#x201c;Throughout this lucid account, Bronowski comes across as a complex and fascinating figure whose own writings merit a renewed readership today.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x2015;Publishers Weekly</p><p><b>Timothy Sandefur</b> is vice president for litigation at the Goldwater Institute in Phoenix, Arizona, where he also holds the Duncan Chair in Constitutional Government. He is the author of several books, including <i>Frederick Douglass: Self-Made Man </i>(2018), <i>The Permission Society </i>(2016), and&nbsp;<i>The Conscience of The Constitution </i>(2014). He has also written dozens of scholarly articles on subjects ranging from Indian law to antitrust, slavery and the Civil War, and political issues in Shakespeare, ancient Greek drama, and <i>Star Trek</i>. He is an adjunct scholar with the Cato Institute, a graduate of Hillsdale College and Chapman University School of Law.From the Introduction<br><br>One contemporary said that Jacob Bronowski (pronounced &#x201c;Bro-<i>noff</i>-ski&#x201d;) was &#x201c;not one man but a multitude.&#x201d; Many others have called him a &#x201c;polymath.&#x201d; In one sense, however, such descriptions are inappropriate, for they assume that his many interests lay in separate fields. &#x201c;Dr. Bronowski,&#x201d; as virtually everyone in Europe affectionately called him, saw all his pursuits as connected &#x2014; as components of the philosophy he called &#x201c;scientific existentialism,&#x201d; and, later, &#x201c;human specificity.&#x201d; What seemed to others separate disciplines were in his view only different colors on a spectrum refracted by the prism of human experience. Combining these different approaches, he believed, would enable mankind to formulate a &#x201c;philosophy that shall be of a whole.&#x201d; He expressed his vision of &#x201c;human specificity&#x201d; when he said that it:<br><br>"does not treat any part of the universe as dead; it treats it as something which changes and evolves and, more important, our understanding of which is a constant creative change. . . . What we want to understand is not only man as he is but as he can be, and the societies which the changing man can make. It is the potential of man that we must explore; it is the fulfillment of man that we must seek. By contrast, it is precisely the doctrines of the Dark Ages which treat man as fixed and dead, a sinful exhibit who can seek virtue only in self-denial. These ascetic virtues are equally the marks of the dead societies of the Middle Ages which we still perpetuate &#x2014; societies constantly on the brink of famine, in which the greatest virtue of man was to achieve the heroics of an insect in a colony, and sacrifice himself for the hive. We are somewhat past those famine days, and we should be past those famine virtues."<br><br>Bronowski&#x2019;s life reflected his love affair with ideas. He was involved with nearly every major intellectual undertaking of the twentieth century, and he could count as his personal acquaintances such giants as Leo Szilard, inventor of the atomic bomb and his best friend in his last years; Samuel Beckett, with whom he co-edited a book when Beckett was still an unknown poet; Francis Crick, who succeeded Bronowski at the Salk Institute, and James Watson, in whose wedding he served as best man; Prime Ministers Hugh Gaitskell and Harold Wilson, whom he advised on science policy; C.P. Snow, who acknowledged him as the real initiator of the &#x201c;Two Cultures&#x201d; debate &#x2014; and many, many others. In the 1920s, he was present when the discovery of the positron was announced. In 1945, he walked through the devastation at Nagasaki and Hiroshima. He was a popular celebrity on television, and a serious philosopher who contributed important insights on epistemology and ethics. He wrote plays, poetry, and even a light opera &#x2014; and created what is probably the finest documentary film ever made, <i>The Ascent of Man</i>.<br><br>No biographer can hope to encompass all of a subject&#x2019;s life, and it is not the aim of this book to do so. Instead, my focus is on Bronowski the intellectual, the engaged thinker of the twentieth century. That explains the long delay in the preparation of this book, for I started work on it more than twenty years ago, only to discover that understanding his career required me to learn about everything from genetics, to philosophical arguments about artificial intelligence, the history of antinuclear arms activism, eighteenth-century poetry, World War II bombing strategies . . . and so on. I will not pretend to have mastered these subjects, and any errors I have made in discussing them are my own. But in the effort, I have benefited from interviews and consultations with many people and institutions.&nbsp;<br><br>----------------------------------<br><br>From Chapter 13 - <i>The Ascent of Man</i><br><br>Today, more than four decades after it premiered, <i>The Ascent of Man</i> remains an artistic and educational masterpiece, and the culmination of Bronowski&#x2019;s forty-five years of thought, weaving together his views on the validity of induction, the poetry of William Blake, the moral questions involved in the atomic bombing of Japan, the relationship between art and science, the causes of war, and even his analysis of <i>Australopithecus</i> teeth. For its narrative framework, he drew on <i>The Western Intellectual Tradition</i>, to present an outline that is simultaneously historical and conceptual &#x2014; following a rough chronological order, while at the same time grouping discussions around distinct subjects. As a result, each episode stands on its own as an hour-long meditation on some profound theme.<br><br>But the <i>Ascent</i> is not a mere catalogue of Bronowski&#x2019;s beliefs; it expresses scientific and philosophical ideas with a unity and poetry that penetrates several layers of the human condition. With its exotic locations, its striking special effects and music, and its often unexpected examples to demonstrate abstract concepts, the <i>Ascent</i> is a monument to the elegant filmmaking of an ambitious era of long-form documentaries. &#x201c;What I did not want to do was conduct a promenade of intellectual monuments,&#x201d; he explained to an interviewer. Much as he admired <i>Civilisation</i>, he wanted &#x201c;to avoid the impression of an endless procession through a picture gallery.&#x201d;<br><br>Ingenious choices by directors like Malone and Mick Jackson ensured that the completed series was elegant and memorable far beyond the didactic style of such sound-stage efforts as <i>Insight</i>. One episode, for example, begins with an arresting slow-motion close-up of a match being struck &#x2014; globules of chemicals peel off the head as the friction raises the temperature; then the smoke boils away from a sudden burst of yellow flames. The match then lights a Bunsen burner, which performs an alchemical experiment that transforms a red powdery substance into a shiny bead of mercury. Bronowski&#x2019;s wise visage then looms up in silvery reflection, to begin a discussion of chemistry and atomic structure. The whole action is fluid and alive.<br><br>Viewers are not only taught, but drawn into the atmosphere of wonder and fascination that made up Bronowski&#x2019;s own personality. That personality is the pivot on which the <i>Ascent</i> turns, and it contributes the series&#x2019; most remarkable feature &#x2014; its apparent spontaneity. Although the film was scripted &#x2014; at length, the script took up almost a shelf in the BBC archive &#x2014; long segments were ad-libbed. After brief planned narrations, the camera frequently turns to the host, standing in some dramatic location &#x2014; a rock outcropping in the desert, above the blue glow of a nuclear reactor, or among the ancient walls of Jericho &#x2014; who proceeds to speak extemporaneously in his almost hypnotic style. The most extraordinary example comes in the final episode, which consists almost entirely of an hour-long unscripted monologue delivered in Bronowski&#x2019;s La Jolla living room.<br><br>The series&#x2019; subtitle, &#x201c;A Personal View,&#x201d; does not merely echo the subtitle of <i>Civilisation</i>; it is literal: <i>The Ascent of Man</i> gives Bronowski&#x2019;s views on everything from geometry, to art, to epistemology, to sex and morality, and especially his conviction that knowledge is an intensely personal adventure. Today, some parts seem dated. . . . But for the most part, Bronowski&#x2019;s scientific and historical exploration of civilization&#x2019;s great ideas is accurate, fascinating, and lucidly, even lyrically, explained in the vivid style that was his trademark. Whether discussing the theory of relativity, the invention of the periodic table, the social consequences of steam power, or the architectural innovations sparked by the invention of the arch, he seems to radiate profundity at the beauty of thought itself. In short, <i>The Ascent of Man</i> is not merely a documentary about the history of science; nor is it even a mere testament of human specificity. It is, rather, the great poem that Bronowski wanted all his life to complete &#x2014; it is his <i>De Rerum Natura</i>.</p><h2>The Cold War (20th Century Perspectives)</h2><p>This book examines one of the most significant eras of turmoil in the 20th century. Read will learn everything from how East Germans escaped over the Berlin Wall, to how the United States and Russia spied on each other during the Cold War.</p><p>David Taylor is a Heinemann Raintree author.Grade 5-9-These titles offer brief discussions of the major events leading up to and significant incidents that were part of the periods they cover. The Cold War presents a discussion of the roots of the distrust between east and west following World War II, and explains some of the major confrontations that took place between the Soviet Union and the western nations (including the Vietnam conflict). Vietnam begins with an overview of the war, followed by a discussion of its root causes. Vietnam's historical relationship with China is described, as is the role of the French, pre- and post-World War II, and the ever-deepening U.S. involvement in the region. Both books are richly illustrated with photographs of the places, events, and people discussed in the texts, and include a number of excellent illustrative maps and drawings. Picture captions are enclosed in colored boxes and insert materials are highlighted in colored background, providing a visually engaging and eye-pleasing layout. Both narratives are clear and informative, and offer readers good introductions to the subjects, making very complex content accessible. Unfortunately, the illustrations on the opening spread of Cold War look cluttered and cartoonlike, creating a negative first impression that the content quickly dispels. Although there are many fine books on these subjects, especially for older students, as a look at the bibliographies confirms, libraries should consider adding these titles.<br><i>Linda Greengrass, Bank Street College Library, New York City </i><br>Copyright 2001 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Need</h2><p><p>Zara collects phobias the way other high school girls collect facebook friends.

Sent to Maine after witnessing the death of her beloved stepfather, Zara is drawn into a local mystery: boys are disappearing in the woods. Narrator Julia Whelan ratchets up the tension as Zara begins to hear a voice calling her into the woods as well. Gifted narration gives depth to Zara&#39;s character. The listener feels her numbing depression over the death of the man she considered her best friend. With equal ease Whelan communicates her renewed energy and enthusiasm as she comes out of herself, meets a handsome new friend who may be more than he appears, and confronts evil, possibly finding justice in the process.

Her most celebrated series is the Dragonrider&#39;s of Pern saga.A new entry in McCaffrey's Brain/Brawn series begun with The Ship Who Sang (1969) and continued by McCaffrey with various collaborators. The Brain here is Carialle, a bodiless human wired into spaceship SSS-900; the Brawn is supplied by Carialle's human partner, Keff. Explorers Carialle and Keff hope to achieve alien contact. Unfortunately, they also need to make discoveries that generate money and kudos: Cencom might not renew their contract, since a prior unpleasant experience has left Carialle psychologically vulnerable to bureaucratic shutdown. On the chilly planet Ozran they discover a population of furry humanoids ruled by irascible and arrogant ``wizards'' wielding what apparently are magic powers. The wizards take Keff captive but do not immediately learn of Carialle's existence. Keff is aided by Plennafrey, a young, beautiful, and rebellious wizard, and the more powerful Chaumel, who is at least willing to listen. Carialle, you see, has discovered that the source of the wizards' power is a projector called the core of Ozran, set up ages ago by one of two long- vanished, advanced alien races. The Core was designed to function as a weather control device, and in using it to power their magic, the wizards have doomed the planet to a slow, cold extinction. Only after Carialle reveals that the ubiquitous globe-frogs are actually the previous masters of Ozran, and that they are willing to help once the wizards cease their bickering, are the wizards persuaded to mend their ways. Bright and bubbly entertainment, though, despite the adult content, decidedly juvenile in style and tone; therefore more likely to appeal to the younger sections of McCaffrey's audience. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The ghastly stars of a wildly popular book series are about to pop up everywhere. (Age 5 and up)</b><br><br>They're grotesque. They're absurd. They're so ugly they're cute - and they could only be spawned by the mind of award-winning comedian Ricky Gervais. From a planet far away, these bizarre and whimsical beasts - from the ferocious airborne Bletchling to the badly behaved Grundit to the fatally timid Splunge - spring to life in the droll and off-the-cuff prose of a writer who some may liken to a latter-day Edward Lear. Then again, some may find these grossly amusing creatures simply-gross. And whose fault is that? Just remember: don&#x2019;t pull a tab just because you&#x2019;ve been told to!</p><p>Ricky Gervais, author of the best-selling, award-winning Flanimals series, is well known as the creator and star of The Office and Extras.

He lives in New York.Grade 4&#x2013;6&#x2014;Adding another dimension&#x2014;the third, to be exact&#x2014;to many of the garish, glutinous creatures portrayed in British comedian Gervais's three previous galleries doesn't improve their looks any, but definitely adds to their gonzo appeal. From the glaring purple Mernimbler to the bizarrely portmanteau Squeeg ("thought to be the missing link between prehistoric Strankulators and the first Dunklings"), more than two dozen bulbous-eyed monsters rear up, slide past, or, in the case of the "jub-wobbling" Splunge (scientific name: Jello Snurbloid), explode in a mix of large central pop-ups and smaller figures in folded corner booklets. One particularly notable spread titled "Flanimal Evolution" sideswipes a certain famous Michelangelo painting. The paper engineering is more varied and inventive than Gervais's free-association commentary, but the stream of nonsense words have a giggle-inducing cumulative effect. Not only should this be popular on its own, but a "Flanimals" film due out in 2011 will also likely crank up demand.&#x2014;<i>John Peters, New York Public Library</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Called by some the "<i>Gone with the Wind </i>of the West," and applauded by others as "rings true and poignant, as authentic and moving as <i>Dances with Wolves</i>."<br> <br> In <i>Uncompahgre</i>, the time nears when the first of the next generation of <i>Threads West </i>characters will be born of the brave men and courageous women who have come so far and risked all. The men and women of the saga, having reached their initial destination, pre-Denver, Cherry Creek, are each faced with life-altering decisions. Some must decide to pursue or abandon torrid love affairs that have flowered on the dangerous journey from Europe and across America. Their lives shaken by events they could not foresee and convergence with souls they could never image, they begin to build a nation that's essence is in transition. They have neither country nor culture in common but their dreams and survival demand a tension filled emergence stitched by fate and history. The Oglala Sioux family struggles to cope with the inevitable change casting shadows upon their lands, culture and scared traditions. The elderly slave couple, and the renegade and his young, traumatized captive introduced in <i>Maps of Fate</i>, are bound ever more tightly to the arc of the story--their tragedy and triumph-filed tales weaving into the fabric of a collective destiny, the black-hearted captor unknowingly catapulted by his tortured past into possible redemption.

Haydon</h2><p>Now published for the first time, For Country, Cause &amp; Leader offers an eyewitness account of the Civil War by a Union soldier who fought from Bull Run to Knoxville. This remarkable book presents the transcription of some twenty pocket diaries kept throughout the first three years of the Civil War by Charles B. Haydon and sent back one by one to his home in Decatur, Michigan, to be read by his father and brother. As readable as they are lively and informative, they offer a marvelous firsthand view of the war and constitute an important addition to our Civil War library.<br>Haydon served through some of the most important engagements of the period. He began as a third sergeant and ended as a lieutenant colonel. In the East he witnessed the rush to the colors, the first Bull Run, the building of the Army of the Potomac, the Peninsula campaign, and the fighting at second Bull Run and Fredericksburg. Early in 1863 his regiment was transferred to the western theater, where it served in Kentucky and under Grant at Vicksburg. Haydon was severely wounded in Mississippi. During the winter of 1863-64 he was in Tennessee and engaged in the campaigning around Knoxville. In March 1864 - ironically, on his way home on furlough - Haydon contracted pneumonia and died.<br>Charles Haydon had considerably more education than the average soldier, and his journal reflects the fact. A good half-dozen years older than most of his fellow recruits, he had studied for four years at the University of Michigan, read law, and was in practice when he volunteered. His journal, which was meant to be read, was a deliberate and conscientious attempt to record his experiences and thoughts of the war.</p><p>STEPHEN W. SEARS is the author of many award-winning books on the Civil War, including Gettysburg and Landscape Turned Red. The New York Times Book Review has called him &#34;arguably the preeminent living historian of the war&#39;s eastern theater.&#34; He is a former editor for American Heritage.An important addition to the growing number of diaries, memoirs, and other primary source materials on the Civil War made accessible to the nonspecialist reader. Sears (To the Gates of Richmond, 1992, etc.) has skillfully edited 19 pocket diaries that the ``good soldier Haydon,'' a 27- year-old lawyer from Decatur, Michigan, painstakingly wrote, transcribed, and sent home to his father from 1861 to 1864. Haydon was a college graduate who read The Atlantic and quoted scraps of poetry to combat the boredom of army life, but the real value of his daybooks is historical and emotional rather than literary. Rising from sergeant to lieutenant colonel, Haydon saw action at or on the edges of both Bull Run battles and at Fredericksburg, more seriously during the ``Seven Days'' on the Peninsula. In 1863, he joined Grant at Vicksburg and was badly wounded leading an assault at Jackson, Mississippi. Unless you're a memoir-gourmet, Haydon's diaries aren't easy reading: Descriptions of the weather and of the awful, inadequate food become repetitious. Nonetheless, there's scarcely a day's entry that doesn't contain some stirring observation or moving reflection, all conveying a genuine mid- Victorian sensibility preserved amid unparalleled carnage. Haydon was obsessed with doing his duty, not only for the Union but in order to be seen as dutiful. (At one point, he writes that there's so much false illness that ``good soldiers sometimes suffer much pain and inconvenience rather than incur the suspicion of shirking duty.'') Readers who would otherwise wonder at troops like those who pinned their names to their coats for the purpose of identifying their corpses as they prepared to run into the cannon's mouth at Cold Harbor will here receive the authentic feel of the era's moral imperative. Survivor of many battles but weakened by his wounds, Haydon died of pneumonia in 1864, while on furlough. In this book of his own making, aided by Sears's introduction and deft chapter transitions, he at last receives his true memorial. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Unfortunately that is impossible for a vampire who is the only one "living" in the small town of Bathory. Now starting 10th grade, he faces some typical teen problems. His friend Henry seems to be dumping him to hang out with the popular crowd. Pesky Eddie is determined to expose him, thinking this will bring him the popularity and fame he desires. Meredith has agreed to be his girlfriend, and he can't believe someone so perfect would want to be with him. He is troubled by terrible nightmares, and the need for human blood is growing extremely difficult to resist, putting Aunt Nelly, Henry, and Meredith at risk. The wicked vampire D'Ablo is determined to get rid of him and steal his powers for himself. Vlad needs to act fast if he is going to save himself and everything he holds dear. The plot is full of twists and turns, but the tone is darker and more intense than in the earlier books as Vlad struggles to overcome the obstacles thrown in his path and come to grips with who and what he really is.

The New York State Attorney General's office brought an unprecedented lawsuit against giant manufacturer GlaxoSmithKline, the maker of Paxil, for consumer fraud. The successful suit launched a tidal wave of protest that changed the way drugs are tested, sold, and marketed in this country.<br><br> With meticulous research, Alison Bass shows us the underbelly of the pharmaceutical industry. She lays bare the unhealthy ties between the medical establishment, big pharma, and the FDA&#x2014;relationships that place vulnerable children and adults at risk every day.</p><p>As the mental health reporter for the <i>Boston Globe</i>, Alison Bass's front-page reporting on conflicts of interest in medical research stunned readers, and her series on sexual misconduct among psychiatrists earned her a Pulitzer Prize nomination. Now she turns her investigative skills to a landmark case that exposed increased suicide rates among adolescents taking popular antidepressants such as Paxil, Prozac, and Zoloft.<br> <br> In <i>Side Effects</i> we meet a courageous Ivy League university employee who risked her job to expose suspicious practices at her lab, a feisty assistant attorney general who spearheaded an unprecedented lawsuit against a pharmaceutical giant, plus the medical researchers who were being paid by the drug companies whose products they were testing. And Bass introduces us to the vulnerable children and adults placed at risk because of greed, corruption, and negligence.<br><br> Though pediatric prescriptions of Paxil&#x2014;at the time one of the world's bestselling antidepressants&#x2014;were soaring, there was no hard proof that the drug performed any better than sugar pills in children and adolescents. Bass reveals how data from drug trials and the suicide risk the drug posed were withheld, allowing GlaxoSmithKline, the maker of Paxil, to mislead physicians and consumers about the safety and efficacy of the drug.<br> <br> When the New York State attorney general's office brought its lawsuit against GlaxoSmithKline for consumer fraud, it launched a tidal wave of protest. As a result of this case, drug companies agreed to publish negative results from their research studies. A congressional investigation into industry practices finally prompted the FDA to mandate strict warnings for all antidepressants.<br> <br> In the tradition of <i>A Civil Action</i>, <i>Side Effects</i> goes behind the scenes of the headline-making case that forced the government to start protecting its citizens.

And since it's not becoming for a cowboy to be arguing, I've made a few wagers in my day. But in my humble opinion, I'm no hustler. You see, neighbor, I never go looking for a sucker. I look for a champion and make a sucker out of him." </p><p>Amarillo Slim might be the greatest gambler who ever lived, but it's his down-home charm and folksy storytelling that have made him an American idol and media darling. Slim is a legend, as American as Paul Bunyan, Jesse James, and P.T. Barnum. In <em>Amarillo Slim in a World Full of Fat People,</em> T.A. "Amarillo Slim" Preston will tell the tall tales of his fascinating life. Slim will describe some of his greatest gambling exploits -- from winning the World Series of Poker to creating extraordinary proposition bets to running the biggest black market in Europe during the war while giving pool exhibitions (read: hustling) on military bases for Uncle Sam. Among others, Slim beat Willie Nelson for $300,000 playing dominoes; Larry Flynt for $2 million playing poker. He has played poker with presidents Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon, and drug lords Pablo Escobar and Jimmy Chagra. He was also one of the pioneers of Las Vegas. Plain and simple, Amarillo Slim is America's greatest gambler of all time.</p></p><p><p></p>Thomas Austin "Amarillo Slim" Preston has won the World Series of Poker and is the author of <em>Amarillo Slim in a World Full of Fat People</em>. Married, with three children and seven grandbabies, he lives in Amarillo, Texas, of course.<br><br>Greg Dinkin is a columnist for <em>Card Player</em> Magazine and is the author of <em>The Finance Doctor</em> and <em>The Poker MBA</em> (Crown Business).Legendary gambler Amarillo Slim Preston, who captured the World Series of Poker in 1972 and has legitimately snookered more money out of more people than most of us make in a lifetime, steers clear of elaborating on the particulars of such games as Texas Hold 'Em in this off-the-cuff, even flighty tour through his often literally death-defying adventures. Since he's played with the likes of Evel Knievel, Willie Nelson and Minnesota Fats, it is a smooth narrative decision on Preston's part to devote his folksy charm to describing the various characters he has encountered, not the mechanics of how he always beat them (his first rule for poker success is "Play the players more than you play the cards"). He was eventually able to make a career out of gambling, sending his three children to college and leading a comfortable life on his winnings (perhaps the most revealing episode arrives late in the memoir when the nationally known gambler who charmed the now- deceased drug lord Pablo Escobar talks about his joy in coaching his children's Little League team). Like all natural-born sharps, though, Preston knows the virtue of keeping his cards close to his chest, which is a fine strategy at the poker table, but a poor narrative one. Passing phrases such as "I got into some tax trouble" are left curiously unexplained while the author's more self-aggrandizing adventures garner elaborate attention. But when an author has won $2 million from Larry Flynt, and tells the story of it so good-naturedly, readers will pardon the selective nature of his reminiscences. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Memoirs of Barry Lyndon</h2><p>Originally published in 1898.

For his kingdom, he chose a vast Spanish land grant near Taos, a wild 100,000 acres whose ancient title was beyond question. Obsessed, he poured more than 20 years into his dream of glory, and schemed, stole, lied, cajoled, begged, and bribed to take the vast grant from its rightful owners. With great mastery, Waters draws us into this obsession, and the intense drama of these years is at once psychological and historical. In May 1913, Manby came at last to possess the grant, but within three years it had slipped again from his grasp.<br><br>The story does not end there, and perhaps only Frank Waters could have portrayed the strange disintegration of Manby&#x2019;s personality as he aged, his frantic but ingenious efforts to regain &#x201c;his&#x201d; land. Among these was the creation of a secret society which terrorized whole towns and villages, becoming so powerful that even Manby no longer knew all its members and workings. At the same time he turned deeper inward, locked and bolted his gates against the outside world which hated and feared him more than ever. On July 3, 1929, a swollen, headless body was discovered in Manby&#x2019;s Taos home. Some said it was murder; others swore the body was not Manby&#x2019;s; still others reported seeing him alive afterward. The story blazed into national headlines and an official inquiry followed. Step by step, Waters takes us into the web of strange clues, evidence, more murders and complications&#x2014;an investigation which the New Mexican government inexplicably called to a halt. The case remains the West&#x2019;s greatest unsolved mystery.</p><p></p><h2>New York Dawn and Dusk - A Book of 30 Postcards</h2><p>Brand new! soft paperback with THIRTY (30) stunning HIGH QUALITY color postcards of various New York landmarks and scenes by photography Jon Ornter.

Ives Memos</h2><p><p><strong>A source book incorporating all the most important unpublished writings of America&#x2019;s great composer.</strong></p> Here are most of the previously unpublished writings of Charles E. Ives: a primary source book on this unique American composer. These "Memos," as Ives called them, were on separate leaves and dealt with his music, composition, criticism, autobiography, biography, and many other topics. During his lifetime Ives rearranged them, lent them out, mislaid and tucked them away in books so that, in the late 1940s, only about three-fifths of them were available to his biographer. After his death in 1954, Ives's papers were gradually put in order, and in time most of the remaining leaves came to light. These two &#x201c;batches&#x201d; are here dovetailed into a three-part form by John Kirkpatrick, who has devotedly arranged, edited, and annotated them. Part One, &#x201c;<em>Pretext</em>,&#x201d; sets forth Ives's aims, his views on music, critics and criticism. In part Two, "<em>Scrapbook</em>," Ives discusses his music. Part Three, "<em>Memories</em>," is devoted to biographical and autobiographical remembrances.</p><p>John Kirkpatrick (b. 1905 &#x2013; d. 1991) was an American classical pianist and music scholar. He was professor emeritus of music and former curator of the Ives collection at Yale University. Previously he taught at Cornell University for twenty-two years.

He has written and illustrated over 30 picture books for children..Ages 2-5. Mishap upon hilarious mishap follows one upon another when Fix-It Duck sets out to repair what he believes is his leaking roof. First Duck borrows a ladder from Sheep. But the skylight on Sheep's trailer is stuck, so well-intentioned Duck attempts to fix it. Instead, he breaks the window. Now Duck must tow Sheep's trailer into Goat's shed, where it will be out of the rain. But how to tow the trailer? Duck saws off the ladder he borrowed and uses it as a hitch, which works just fine until a swerve on a curve sends Duck's truck off in one direction--and the trailer in another. And so the slapstick fun proceeds, all of it presented in vibrantly colored frames of funny cartoon art that is well matched to Alborough's quick-footed rhyme: "'Look up the hill,' gasps Goat in dismay. 'It's Sheep,' quacks Duck, 'And he's coming this way!'" This entertaining adventure is sure to be a read-aloud favorite; try pairing it with Duck's previous escapade <i>Duck in the Truck</i> (1999) or one of Nancy Shaw's wacky sheep books, such as <i>Sheep in a Jeep</i> (1986). <i>Ellen Mandel</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Gemmell&#x2019;s first novel <i>Legend</i>, published in 1984, has become a fantasy classic, and <i>Hero in the Shadows</i> went to number three on the <i>Sunday Times</i> bestseller list.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i>The winter in the northern mountains was the most vicious in more than thirty years. Rivers and lakes lay under a foot of ice, and fierce blizzards raged across the land for days on end. Sheep trapped in snowdrifts died in scores, and only the hardiest of the cattle would live to see the spring. Many roads were impassable throughout Black Mountain, and the townspeople struggled to survive. Highlanders of the Black Rigante came out of the mountains, bringing food and supplies, aiding farmers, seeking out citizens trapped in lonely homes high in the hills.<br><br>Even so many died, frozen in their beds.<br><br>Few ventured out into the wilderness between Black Mountain and the craggy western peaks of the Rigante homeland.<br><br>Kaelin Ring was wishing he was not one of them as he struggled through the bitter cold toward the high cabin of Finbarr Ustal. Laboring under a heavy pack to which was strapped a new long-barreled musket, Kaelin pushed up the last steep hill. Ice shone brightly in his dark beard, and the long, white scar on his right cheek felt as if it were burning. His legs ached from the unaccustomed strides necessitated by the wide snowshoes he wore. Kaelin pushed on, growing ever more weary. At twenty-three he was a powerful young man. In summer he would run, sometimes for ten miles over the hills, reveling in the strength and stamina of his youth. At this moment he felt like an old man, his muscles exhausted, his body crying out for rest. Anger flared. Rest here and you&#x2019;ll die, he told himself.<br><br>His dark eyes scanned the hill ahead. The slope was steep and stretched on and up for another half mile. He paused and clumsily readjusted the straps of his pack. Kaelin was wearing two pairs of gloves, one pair of lamb&#x2019;s wool and the second of rabbit fur. Even so his fingers felt numb. A fierce wind blew down over the hills, lifting snow in flurries, stinging his face and eyes. The wind billowed his sheepskin hood, flicking it back from his face. With a curse Kaelin grabbed at it, hauling it back into place. The sky above was gray and heavy with snow clouds. Kaelin stared balefully at the slope ahead. He was coming to the end of his strength. To die here would be laughable, he told himself. Never to see Chara again or his little son Jaim. &#x201c;It will not happen,&#x201d; he said aloud. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll not be beaten by a touch of snow.&#x201d;<br><br>The wind picked up, roaring into his chest and almost throwing him from his feet. &#x201c;Is that the best you can do?&#x201d; shouted Kaelin. Strengthened by his anger, he ducked his head into the wind and began to climb. The pain in his legs was growing, his calves tight and cramping.<br><br>As he struggled on, he focused on Finbarr and the welcome he would receive as he entered the warmth and security of the high cabin.<br><br>Finbarr had worked at Ironlatch Farm for several years, but the previous year he had come to live in the northwest cabin with his wife and two surviving children. His oldest boy had died two years earlier. Employed by Maev Ring to watch over the stock in those mountain pastures, Finbarr patrolled the high country, carrying bales of hay and digging out sheep trapped in the snow. It was tough, demanding work. His wife, Ural, a strong woman, often worked alongside him, as did the two boys.<br><br>Kaelin had not seen the family for more than two months and, caught within one of his wandering moods, had packed some supplies and set off for the cabin. In good weather it was a day&#x2019;s walk from Ironlatch to the high cabin, but in these conditions it had taken the powerful young highlander more than three times that long. He had been forced to spend one whole day in a cliff cave, sheltering from a fierce blizzard.<br><br>Exhausted now, Kaelin began to sweat from the effort of climbing the hill. Fear touched him. In these conditions a man had to move slowly and carefully. At this temperature perspiration would freeze against the skin beneath a man&#x2019;s clothes, draining all warmth from his flesh.<br><br>I am almost there, he thought. The sweat does not matter.<br><br>The sun was dropping low over the mountains as he approached the last quarter mile, and he was now regretting that he had chosen to bring his new long-barreled musket and his two Emburley pistols. Kaelin had planned to do a little hunting with Finbarr and the boys, but now all he wanted was a chair by a warm hearth and to be relieved of the weight of his guns and his pack. He shivered with pleasure at the thought of the heat from Finbarr&#x2019;s fire.<br><br>The boys, Feargol and Basson, would be delighted to see him. The youngsters loved his stories&#x2014;stories he had first heard from the giant Jaim Grymauch when he was their age: tales of Connavar the King and Bane, who had fought in the great arenas of Stone. Basson, the oldest at ten, would sit at Kaelin&#x2019;s feet, his eyes wide, his attention rapt. Feargol, a six-year-old with an unruly mop of red hair, would interrupt the tales constantly, asking the oddest questions. &#x201c;Did Bane wear a hat?&#x201d; he asked one day just as Kaelin was telling the boys the story of a gladiatorial contest between Bane and a Stone warrior.<br><br>&#x201c;Not while he was fighting before the crowd,&#x201d; Kaelin said, patiently. &#x201c;So Bane drew his sword and stepped out before the emperor, a powerful man named&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What kind of a hat did he wear when he wasn&#x2019;t fighting?&#x201d; asked Feargol.<br><br>&#x201c;Will you be quiet?&#x201d; snapped Basson, a slim young boy who had inherited his mother&#x2019;s fair skin and blond hair. &#x201c;Who cares if he had a hat?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I like hats,&#x201d; said Feargol.<br><br>&#x201c;He had a woolen hat,&#x201d; said Kaelin, &#x201c;just like yours, with ear protectors. When it was cold, he would let them down and tie them below his chin. In the summer he would lift the earflaps up and tie them at the top of the hat.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What color was it?&#x201d; asked Feargol. &#x201c;Was it white like mine?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, it was white.&#x201d;<br><br>Feargol was delighted. Scrambling up from the floor, he ran back into the bedroom and returned wearing his white hat. Then he sat quietly as Kaelin finished the story.<br><br>The memory lifted Kaelin&#x2019;s mood as he saw the cabin. He pictured the fire and the friendly reception, the boys running out to greet him. Kaelin paused in his climb. There was no smoke coming from the stone chimney. That was odd, for there was enough firewood to last the winter. He and Finbarr had spent weeks hauling and sawing logs, chopping rounds, and stacking the fuel by the north wall.<br><br>As he came closer to the cabin, he saw that the timbers of the west wall had been caved in and part of the roof had fallen. Then, out of the corner of his eye, he saw something red flicker in a nearby tree. Squinting against the fierce cold wind and the flurrying snow, Kaelin focused on the tree. Finbarr&#x2019;s oldest son, Basson, dressed in a thin red nightshirt, was clinging to the upper branches. Kicking off his snowshoes, Kaelin scrambled up the last part of the slope, his weariness forgotten. Even as he came to the tree, he knew that the boy was dead.<br><br>The ten-year-old had frozen to death. There was ice in his blond hair, and his skin was blue. Great gouges had been torn from the trunk of the tree below him. Kaelin recognized the marks as the talons of a grizzly. They reached up almost nine feet.<br><br>Moving to the shattered wall of the cabin, he saw that the timbers had been smashed open. There were talon grooves in the shattered wood and blood upon the snow around the ruined door. Shrugging off his pack, he pulled off his gloves. There would be no point trying to load the musket. The firing mechanism would be frozen solid. Opening his heavy sheepskin coat, he pulled one of his long-barreled Emburley pistols from its leather sheath and cocked it. He did not go into the cabin but examined the bloodstained ground. There were bear tracks and a deep channel where something had been dragged toward the trees&#x2014;something leaking gore.<br><br>With a sinking heart Kaelin Ring followed the channel. What he found just inside the tree line sickened him. The remains of the family were scattered there. Finbarr&#x2019;s head&#x2014;half the face bitten away&#x2014;was resting by a tree root. Of Ural there was part of a leg and a ripped and bloody section of skirt. Kaelin had neither the heart nor the stomach to search for signs of the child Feargol.<br><br>He returned to the cabin. There were deep claw marks on the outer, smashed walls. Inside, the table was broken in half and two of the chairs were shattered. Several shelves had been torn from the walls, and the floor was littered with broken crockery. A discharged musket and a pistol lay close to the door of the back bedroom. A broken saber was resting against the far wall, and a bloody kitchen knife had been hurled into the hearth. From what Kaelin could see&#x2014;and the fact that Basson had scrambled up the tree in his nightshirt&#x2014;the bear had come upon the cabin at night. It had smashed at the door and the frame, tearing out the timbers. This had not been done quickly. Finbarr and Ural had had time to load and fire the musket and the pistol. As the bear had come through, they had fought it with sword and knife. Spray patterns of blood on the walls showed that they had died there. Basson must have ducked past the bear and run for the trees.<br><br>Kaelin moved to the hearth. Dropping to one knee, he retrieved the bloodstained kitchen knife. Then he pressed his hand to the hearthstones. They were still barely warm.<br><br>The attack had occurred the previous night.<br><br>Rising, Kaelin walked through to the small back bedroom. There was no sign there of disruption. The boys&#x2019; bunk beds stood against the far wall, opposite the large double bed shared by Finbarr and Ural. Kaelin sat down on the bed. This was a harsh land, and he had both killed men and seen others die on the battlefield. Nothing like this, though.<br><br>It was unheard of for a bear&#x2014;even a grizzly&#x2014;to attack a cabin in this way. Often the beasts would scavenge around for scraps of food, but mostly they would keep away from people. Every highlander knew the two main rules when it came to dealing with such animals. Avoidance came first, especially if it was a mother with cubs or it was feeding or defending a kill. The second rule, if avoidance was not possible, was to remain calm and move slowly away from the beast. Given the choice, bears tended to avoid humans. Most attacks Kaelin had heard of had come when people had blundered upon a feeding bear and surprised it. The rips and tears in the timbers of the cabin showed that this grizzly had launched a frenzied assault in order to reach the people inside.<br><br>He glanced across at the bunk beds and thought of little Feargol in his white cap. Finbarr had been overprotective of both of his sons. He had already lost one child, his oldest boy, to a fever that had been raging in Black Mountain. Finbarr had been determined to keep his other children safe. It was one of the reasons he had moved his family to this high cabin.<br><br>Kaelin shivered, his exhaustion returning. No time now to mourn the dead, he thought.<br><br>The bear would be back to finish his feeding. Kaelin knew he should be long gone when that happened. Cold reality touched his mind. If he left now, he would almost certainly die. He did not have the strength to make it back to the high cave. Kaelin cursed softly. In all likelihood the bear would not come to the cabin. It would eat its fill and return to its lair. Kaelin fetched his pack and carried it back into the main room. Then he prepared a fire. Once the flames caught, he removed his hooded cloak and sheepskin topcoat and squatted down before the blaze. The heat was welcome.<br><br>Outside the light was fading. If the bear did come now. . . .<br><br>Fear touched the young Rigante, and he tried to quell it. &#x201c;If it comes, I&#x2019;ll kill it,&#x201d; he said aloud. The strength of the words calmed him, though only momentarily. Finbarr and Ural had discharged weapons at the beast. They had not stopped him.<br><br>Kaelin added more wood to the fire. His Emburley pistols were more powerful than Finbarr&#x2019;s weapons, and his musket was new. Picking up the weapon, he rubbed at the mechanism with a fire-warmed cloth. Once it was working, he loaded the musket and left it on the floor within easy reach. Warmer now, he began to relax a little as his strength returned. There was a bitter breeze blowing through the ruined wall. Kaelin found Finbarr&#x2019;s box of tools and began to make temporary repairs. The bear had torn out the timbers to the right of the door frame. The frame had buckled and snapped, tearing off the door. Timbers had bent inward, and the bear had struck them, snapping two completely. That had allowed it to enter the cabin. There was no way to repair the frame. Where it had buckled, the roof had dropped. But Kaelin managed to force some of the timbers back and nail them, reinforcing the repair with sections of wood from the broken table. By the end of two hours he had created enough of a barrier to prevent the worst of the weather from freezing the cabin.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>When Vegetables Go Bad</h2><p><p> "The trouble with Ivy was, she wouldn't eat her vegetables."

In addition to the first two volumes of <b>The Life of Graham Greene</b>, he is the author of <b>Conrad&#x2019;s Eastern World</b>, <b>Conrad&#x2019;s Western World</b>, <b>Charlotte and Emily Bront�</b>, and <b>Jane Austen</b>.</p>The celebrated novelist chose his biographer because, according to Sherry, he was impressed with his studies of Joseph Conrad, and by the fact that he had journeyed to the places his subject had known. That was 14 years ago, and in the course of preparing this massive study of Greene (still very much alive at 84), Sherry trod in the novelist's wide-ranging footsteps too. He also was given access to Greene's remarkable letters, granted occasional, highly reluctant interviews by his reclusive subject, and even managed to unearth Britons who knew him at school. The portrait that results is riveting, going to the heart of Greene's darkly anguished worldview and the anxieties, guilts and demons that have driven him to create more than 30 novels, travel books and essay collections. From the start, as a pupil at a school where his father was headmaster, Greene was unhappily out of place, aware in the bullying of his schoolfellows of the omnipresence of evil. He suffered agonizingly from boredom and as an Oxford student went on harebrained cloak-and-dagger trips to Germany and Ireland in search of danger; in extremity, he played Russian roulette with a loaded revolver. Some of this has been recounted in Greene's own eliptical memoirs, A Sort of Life and Ways of Escape , but Sherry expands on them convincingly, showing what the novelist evaded or omitted. Entirely new, too, are the details of Greene's romantically obsessive courtship of Vivien, the wife for whose sake he embraced Roman Catholicism. Sherry is as good on the literary side as on the personal. Greene's books are exhaustively mined for sources--Sherry's travels yield remarkable discoveries, including the identities of some of the people who were fashioned into characters in Brighton Rock and The Power and the Glory --and judiciously evaluated. Greene's early journalism, his fascination with the movies and his years as a reviewer also make absorbing chapters. Biography on this scale, and of this quality, is rare and justifies its length. The second volume is eagerly awaited.

In <i>Can't Find My Way Home,</i> journalist and filmmaker Martin Torgoff chronicles what a long strange trip it's been as the American Century became the Great Stoned Age. <br> Weaving together first-person accounts and historical background, <i>Can't Find My Way Home</i> is a narrative vast in scope yet rich in intimate detail. Torgoff tells the stories of those whose lives became synonymous with the drug culture, from Charlie Parker, Allen Ginsberg, Timothy Leary, and John Belushi to ordinary people who felt their consciousness "expanded" or who plumbed the depths of addiction. He also examines the broader impact of drugs on society and politics, from the war on drugs to the recovery movement, and the continuing debate over drug policy. A vivid work of cultural history that neither demonizes nor romanticizes its subject, <i>Can't Find My Way Home</i> is a provocative and fascinating look at how drugs have entered the American mainstream.</p><p>Martin Torgoff came of age just about the same time as the drug boom, a circumstance that informs his overview of America's "Great Stoned Age." Chronicling the irrepressible onslaught of mind-altering substances from the end of World War II through the close of the century, Torgoff (whose previous publishing efforts have centered around rockers Elvis Presley and John Cougar Mellencamp) intersperses the personal with the historical. Laying the groundwork with his own recollections of indulgence beginning in the late 1960s, the author flashes back to the Beat era, which he asserts opened the door for all that followed. Interviews with the obscure and celebrated add color and detail to the chronicle. Here's Herbert Huncke, the unapologetic hustler and heroin addict who lurked on the periphery of '50s bohemian scene and turned up as a character in William Burroughs' pulp memoir <i>Junkie</i>. Into the 1960s, there's acid guru Timothy Leary, poet Allan Ginsburg, record producer Paul Rothchild, Woodstock MC Wavy Gravy, and others caught up in a wave of revolutionary experimentation and excess. The '70s leads to the cocaine craze (embodied here by party girl Suzie Ryan), which begets drug wars (with plenty of casualties on both sides), Just Say No, the crack epidemic, and rave culture. While Torgoff's tome is too capricious to serve as the final word on America's drug obsession, it's eminently readable and entertaining, thanks to its expansive, pop-culture-informed tone. There's an almost insane momentum to this tale, with dozens of astonishing twists and turns. Imagine Jimmy Carter's drug czar, Dr. Peter Bourne, snorting cocaine at a party thrown the by pot legalization group NORML. Then picture George H.W. Bush's point man on drugs, William Bennett, remarking in an interview that it would be "morally plausible" to behead drug dealers. So much for moderation. <i>--Steven Stolder</i><b>Martin Torgoff</b> has been a contributing editor at <i>Interview</i> and a producer for CNN "World Beat."

Tonya Waters hunched lower in the bullfighter barrel and held her breath.<br><br><i>Don't move. Don't make a sound. Don't even breathe.</i> She closed her eyes and sent up a prayer. Would he look in the barrel? It seemed like such an obvious hiding place. Then again, it was one of many barrels in the equipment room. It would take him a while to search each one. Hopefully, she would be able to get out before he reached her.<br><br>But the footsteps moved closer to her. That sickening sweet cologne she remembered from four years ago tickled her gag reflex. She swallowed and curled into herself as tight as she dared. Her fingers, gripping the straps that had been mounted on the inside of the sphere, went numb.<br><br>"Tonya?"<br><br>His low singsong voice sent shivers of fear coursing through her. Stars danced before her eyes and she drew in another shallow breath. If she passed out, it was over. The stars faded. She lifted her head a fraction, just enough to see out of the top of the barrel.<br><br>Screams from the rodeo crowd just over her head reached her. Tonya had thought she'd be safe here, be a part of the rodeo, blend in with the crew. She'd been almost positive that the clown makeup and baggy clothes would be enough of a disguise should any pictures appear in a newspaper or on the news. Being a rodeo clown&#x2014;or a bullfighter, as some were called&#x2014;was hard work, exhilarating work.

And now he'd come after her one more time. <i>God, help me!</i><br><br>His good-looking exterior hid a heart of evil. Of violence and the potential to kill. Her throat tightened at the memory. He'd wrapped his fingers around her throat and pressed. Tight, tighter. Until she'd passed out. He'd dropped her to the floor and walked out, leaving her for dead.<br><br>She'd pressed charges and sent him to jail. And not even his powerful lawenforcement family could stop it. The fingerprints he'd left on her throat had matched his and a jury had put him away. But he hadn't stayed locked up for long. He'd shown up a few months later at her office, where she'd been working only a few weeks. Fortunately, she'd seen him before he'd seen her and she'd slipped out of the office without a backward glance, knowing she would never be safe as long as he was free.<br><br>And now he was here. Looking for revenge.<br><br>Her eyes closed, not wanting to remember the hate on his face in the courtroom. "I'll come after you, Tonya. You're mine. If I can't have you, no one will."<br><br>The whispered clich� often made her awaken drenched in a fear-induced sweat.<br><br>How had Hank found her? The question tumbled through her mind as her muscles began to cramp. She listened. He hadn't spoken a word except her name. She hadn't heard footsteps except the ones that had brought him next to her hiding place.<br><br>What was he <i>doing?</i><br><br>Listening for her just as intently as she was listening for him.<br><br>Tears leaked down her cheeks.<br><br>A scraping sound against the floor brought her head up. Another scrape. More footsteps. A barrel rocking. Terror thundered through her. <i>No, no, no.</i><br><br>He was searching the barrels.<br><br>She could <i>feel</i> him getting closer, heard him mutter something under his breath.<br><br>"Hey, what are you doing in here? This room is for approved personnel only."<br><br>Tonya jerked, then nearly cried in relief. She recognized Seth Starke's voice. A buckaroo. A tall, good-looking bull rider whose blue eyes she'd spent way too much time noticing lately. But one who had impeccable timing. <i>Thank You, Lord.</i><br><br>"Uh, sorry. I took a wrong turn. I was, uh...looking for something," a voice said. Hank's voice, that deep bass that she'd just started to push from her memory. She'd know it anywhere.<br><br>"Well, come on out of there. What can I help you find?"<br><br>"The restroom?"<br><br>Seth snorted. "Try up the hall and on the right."<br><br>"Of course. Thanks."<br><br>Tonya listened to the fading footsteps and finally the door shut with a soft click. She let her muscles relax and winced at the pain as the blood began to flow once again. When she could, she stood and climbed out of the barrel on still-shaky legs, then shot a glance at the clock on the wall. She was going to be late.<br><br>Hank Newman was here. Frustration and terror clawed at her. She didn't want to run. She liked her life and what she'd built with the rodeo. But what other choice did she have?<br><br>But not until after Seth's ride. It was the last one of the day and then she'd be finished. Then she could plan her next move. But what would that be? Stay and fight back? Or head for the hills? She drew in a deep breath and headed for the door.<br><br>Then paused, her hand on the knob.<br><br>Was he there? Just outside? Waiting for her to step through so he could grab her and wrap his strong, menacing hands around her throat again?<br><br>Tremors shook through her. She leaned her head against the door and tried to calm herself. He wouldn't be there. Seth would have made sure of that. She turned the knob and shoved the door open.<br><br>The figure loomed in front of her. She let out a gasp and swallowed a scream.<br><br>"Hey, are you all right?" Seth grasped Tonya by the arm. She swayed and her stark white face troubled him. He'd admired her from afar for so long it felt strange to actually touch her.<br><br>She drew in a deep breath. "It's you."<br><br>"Yeah. Where did you come from? I didn't see you in there."<br><br>She gave him a shaky smile. "I was hiding." The little laugh she let escape didn't suggest she thought it was funny.<br><br>"Hiding? From...?"<br><br>"The guy you chased off. Thanks for that, by the way."<br><br>Seth frowned as warning bells went off in his mind. "Why were you hiding from him?"<br><br>"Doesn't matter now." She straightened and he realized he was still holding her upper arm. He let go and she tugged at the hem of her colorful long sleeve, fluffed the bright red wig and stuck her jaw out. "We're going to be late."<br><br>Seth followed her glance to the clock on the wall. She was right. They had to get going. "Are you sure you're up to this?" He was concerned. He wanted to know about the fear lingering in her eyes. Color had crept back into her cheeks, but she was still tense, glancing over his shoulder every few seconds as though she expected someone to walk up.<br><br>"I'm fine. Or I will be." Her blue gaze met his, and just like always, he felt drawn to her. She appeared fragile, yet he knew how strong she really was. And brave. No one could face down a thousand-pound bull and not have a spine of steel. That was why the fear in her eyes rattled him. Made him want to confront whatever had scared her. She gave him a light shove toward the men's dressing rooms. "I'll be out there in a minute."<br><br>"I'll wait."<br><br>She shook her head. "Go. You need to get ready. I'm on the way to the arena. I'll be right behind you."<br><br>Another glance at the clock sent urgency shooting through him. She was right&#x2014;he'd have to hurry. "All right." He looked around. "I think that guy is gone."<br><br>"Good. Go. I'll be fine."<br><br>Seth hesitated one more second, then took off, his boots echoing against the concrete floor. He didn't know much about Tonya, just what he'd learned from working with her on an almost daily basis. But what he knew, he liked, and he vowed to make an effort to get to know her better. Soon. The fact that she was scared of the guy Seth had caught in the storage room really worried him. Not only did he vow to get to know Tonya better, he promised to be there for her if she needed him. For friendship, protection...or more.<br><br>Tonya watched Seth leave and reached out to grip the doorframe. Chills pebbled over her skin. Hank Newman had found her. For years she'd never stopped watching over her shoulder and today it had paid off. Sort of. She'd seen him before he'd seen her. He looked different, but she'd recognized him. Almost too late, but quick enough to get away from him.<br><br>Seth Starke had shown up at just the right time. And so had the attraction that she'd been noticing every time she found herself in Seth's presence. But she couldn't think about that right now.<br><br>Confusion flooded through her. What was Hank doing here? No, wrong question. She knew what he was doing here. The main question was: How had he found her?<br><br>Another quick look at the clock had her groaning. She wilted against the doorframe to give herself a few seconds to get it together. Finally, she straightened, scrutinized the few people hurrying toward the stairs that would lead up to the arena. She had a show to finish. Then she could figure out her next move.<br><br>Seth watched Mia Addison entertain the crowd with the two dogs who traveled with her wherever she went. They were great for filling up the downtime that happened between rides and events. Adults loved her show as much as the kids. Seth let his gaze wander the area. Where was Tonya? She'd said she'd be right behind him.<br><br>Tonya Waters. The woman who'd started to come to mind more often than not. He'd thought he'd seen her slip into the supply room and had planned to grab a private moment to ask her out. Only he'd found another man following her.<br><br>Someone who'd scared her enough to send her into hiding. Just as he'd been about to open the door to the storage room and call out to her, she'd opened it herself. The sheer terror that had stared back at him for that brief moment before she realized it was him stayed with him and he planned to ask her about it as soon as he could.<br><br>He drew in a steadying breath and climbed the gate, balancing himself on the top rail. Soon he'd throw his legs over and drop onto the bull who pranced and snorted. He glanced up. Still no Tonya.<br><br>He'd noticed her from the moment he'd met her, but she'd belonged to someone else. Now she was single again, her boyfriend killed in a freak bullfighting accident. He'd heard through the grapevine that Tonya still blamed herself a year later. The sadness in her eyes drew him, made him want to offer comfort. Which was crazy. His eyes scanned the area again. His already tense muscles bunched harder. Had the guy who'd frightened her gone back to find her? Where <i>was</i> she?<br><br>As though in answer to his silent question, Tonya stepped into the arena, rolling her barrel. She wore loose-fitting clothes that would enable her to move freely and quickly. Underneath the brightly colored shirt, she wore a vest. The vest and the barrel would protect her&#x2014;somewhat&#x2014;if the bull came after her.<br><br>Seth shuddered to think of it, but she was a professional. She did her job so he could do his. He swung his legs over the rail fencing and settled himself on the back of the bull. Then he gathered the rosined rope near the bull's neck.<br><br>"You ready for this?" Jake Foster, one of Seth's good friends and another bull rider, asked. "As ready as I'll ever be."<br><br>Jake, Seth Starke, Daniel Sanders and Monty Addison, Mia's brother, had been the four buckaroos. Until Daniel had died. Now it was the three of them, and while they fiercely competed against one another for the prize money, they were best friends who still mourned the loss of Daniel.<br><br>"We going out for drinks after this?" Jake asked.<br><br>"You know I don't drink."<br><br>"Come on, man. You know the strongest thing I'm talking about is a root beer."<br><br>Seth gave a low chuckle. He did know that. Jake was a recovering alcoholic and had been clean for five years. "We'll see how this ride goes."<br><br>"I'll even drive."<br><br>Seth snorted. "No way I'm getting in your trash heap." The man literally had garbage stacked to the ceiling in the backseat of his king cab. Drink cups, food wrappers, magazines and old newspapers. It had become a joke among the friends. No one would ride in Jake's truck for fear of getting lost amid the trash. Seth suspected the man did that on purpose. Sure saved him on gas money when he rode with someone else.<br><br>"I'll clean it out just for you."<br><br>"Right."<br><br>"Seriously, I'll&#x2014;"<br><br>"It's okay, Jake. You don't have to try and take my mind off this ride. I need to focus."<br><br>"I know." His pal shut up and helped Seth settle in. Seth passed the rope between his pinkie and ring finger, then over the top of his hand across the back and around again to thread it under where it crossed his palm. Then he moved the rope between his middle and index fingers and clamped down hard.<br><br>He was ready.<br><br>No, he wasn't.<br><br>Fear flared. "Do you ever think about Daniel before you ride?" he asked through clenched teeth.<br><br>"Every time," Jake said. He'd watched his friend die just as Seth had. Then six months later, Seth had fallen and been horribly injured. He knew Jake had to wonder if he was next.<br><br>"Where's Monty?"<br><br>"He was on the computer in the break room last time I saw him. The orders are rolling in." Monty and several of the other buckaroos ran a side business selling Western wear through an online store. "Don't worry&#x2014;he'll be here. Like you said...you just focus on staying on."<br><br>"Right." Focus would be a good thing. Staying on would be even better.<br><br>For Seth the flashes of falling off the bull six months ago wouldn't fade. He'd been back riding now for two months, training and working. And each time he got on one of the beasts, the images from the past came forward to taunt him. <i>Focus.</i><br><br>Mia and her well-trained dogs ran from the arena to the resounding cheers and applause of the entertained audience. Mia used dogs, while Tonya defied death walking a high wire and being shot out of a cannon. Mia would be back in about fifteen seconds to help Tonya bull-fight.<br><br>The clock ticked. Mia returned in a flash of color and renewed applause. She moved opposite of Tonya and waited on the other side of the gate.<br><br>A third bullfighter, Rhett Jamison, grasped the rope he'd use to pull open the gate when Seth gave him the signal. Tonya met his gaze then gave him a slow nod. The timekeeper held the stopwatch next to Seth's head. He'd press the button as soon as the gate opened. His muscles bunched and he forced them to relax. He'd have to move with the bull, not fight him. He nodded to Rhett.<br><br>Rhett pulled the rope and the gate opened. The bull shot out and went into his rocking north-and-south bucking motion. Seth kept his free arm up, his stomach tight, his weight centered over the hand that gripped the rope, muscled legs clamped against the beast's sides.<br><br><i>Eight seconds. Just do it for eight seconds.</i><br><br>He knew what he was doing. The ride felt right. Good. The fear fled. Exhilaration filled him. He let his body flow with the movement. Time slowed; the roar of the crowd faded. It was just him and the bull.<br><br>The bell sounded. Elation zipped through him. He'd done it again. He'd stayed on. The rope slipped. He frowned and felt himself falling. No, this wasn't supposed to happen. Wha&#x2014;?<br><br>Seth was on the ground, his lungs straining for air. The past rushed back to hit him and he steeled himself for the pain, for the bull to trample him. He tried to breathe, to roll, and couldn't move.<br><br>A hoof hit his newly healed leg. Pain ricocheted through him and blackness descended.<br><br><i></i></p><h2>The Notebook Poems, 1930-34</h2><p>An authoritative and comprehensive guide to all aspects of photography.</p><p>Dylan Thomas was born in Swansea on 27 October 1914, the son of a senior English master. On leaving school he worked on the South Wales Evening Post before embarking on his literary career in London. Not only a poet, he wrote short stories, film scripts, features and radio plays, the most famous being Under Milk Wood. On 9 November 1953, shortly after his thirty-ninth birthday, he collapsed and died in New York city. He is buried in Laugharne, Carmarthenshire, which had become his main home since 1949. In 1982 a memorial stone to commemorate him was unveiled in &#39;Poet&#39;s Corner&#39; in Westminster Abbey.</p><h2>Somersault</h2><p>Ten years after recanting their teachings and abandoning their zealous and violent congregation, two men known only as the Patron and Guide of Humankind seek to overcome a radical faction while leading peaceful followers toward a new future.</p><p>Writing a novel after having won a Nobel Prize for Literature must be even more daunting than trying to follow a brilliant, bestselling debut. In <i>Somersault</i> (the title refers to an abrupt, public renunciation of the past), Kenzaburo Oe has himself leapt in a new direction, rolling away from the slim, semi-autobiographical novel that garnered the 1994 Nobel Prize (<i>A Personal Matter</i>) and toward this lengthy, involved account of a Japanese religious movement. Although it opens with the perky and almost picaresque accidental deflowering of a young ballerina with an architectural model, <i>Somersault</i> is no laugh riot. Oe's slow, deliberate pace sets the tone for an unusual exploration of faith, spiritual searching, group dynamics, and exploitation. His lavish, sometimes indiscriminate use of detail can be maddening, but it also lends itself to his sobering subject matter, as well as to some of the most beautiful, realistic sex scenes a reader is likely to encounter. <i>--Regina Marler</i>Kenzaburo Oe was born in 1935 in the remote mountain village of Ose on Shikoku, the smallest of Japan&#39;s four main islands. Oe is considered one of the most dynamic and revolutionary writers to have emerged in Japan since World War II, and is acknowledged as the first truly modern Japanese writer. Oe is known for his powerful accounts of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and his struggle to come to terms with a mentally handicapped son. His dark musings on moral failure came to symbolize an alienated generation in postwar Japan. Oe&#39;s influences and literary heroes are less Japanese than American and European, ranging from Henry Miller to Jean-Paul Sartre, from Blake to Camus. His prolific body of work has won almost every major international honor, including the 1989 Prix Europalia and the 1994 Nobel Prize for Literature. His many translated works include A Personal Matter, Teach Us to Outgrow Our Madness, The Silent Cry, Hiroshima Notes, and Nip the Buds, Shoot the Kids.</p><h2>Canadian Whisky: The Portable Expert</h2><p>Davin de Kergommeaux takes readers on a journey through the first systematic presentation of Canadian whisky: how it's made, who makes it, why it tastes the way it does, its history, and the rich, centuries-old folklore surrounding it.<br><b>&nbsp;</b><br>Join whisky authority Davin de Kergommeaux on a pan-Canadian journey from British Columbia to Nova Scotia, celebrating the diversity of Canada's unique spirit.

He aches for his mom, whom he sees every other weekend, and he resents his new stepsisters. At school, he acts out, prompting a teacher to call his dad, who helps the young narrator work through his complicated sorrow and anger. Together, his parents come up with solutions, such as bedtime stories read over the phone with mom, and the boy gradually begins to feel secure that he is loved in both homes. The story&#x2019;s messages are overt and the tone is prescriptive, but the narrator&#x2019;s frustrations and the way he expresses them are believable. Children working through similar circumstances may appreciate that the complex emotions are so clearly spelled out, and they&#x2019;ll take heart from the small, concrete family gestures that make a big difference. A long closing note aimed at adults offers further suggestions for helping children cope with divorce and blended families.

The smells of burning <em>copal</em> incense and pungent <em>cempas�chil</em> (marigolds) mingle with the aromas of fresh bread, new clothing, sweets, and candles.

This is a graphic and unsparing story, from the battles and jungle patrols, to the departure of the survivors.</p><p>An old Midwestern saying goes, "There's only a thin red line between the sane and the mad." War seems to stretch that line almost to the breaking point. James Jones's classic World War II novel recounts with brutal honesty the stories of the men of C-for-Charlie Company as they struggle to hold on to their honor, their sanity, and their lives on Guadalcanal. Actor Joe Mantegna turns in an able performance, his voice expressing a roller coaster of emotions (though his Welsh accent may require some patience).

Goldberger&#x2019;s keen observations and sharp wit make him one of the most insightful and passionate architectural voices of our time. In this collection of fifty-seven essays, the critic Tracy Kidder called &#x201c;America&#x2019;s foremost interpreter of public architecture&#x201d; ranges from Havana to Beijing, from Chicago to Las Vegas, dissecting everything from skyscrapers by Norman Foster and museums by Tadao Ando to airports, monuments, suburban shopping malls, and white-brick apartment houses. This is a comprehensive account of the best&#x2014;and the worst&#x2014;of the &#x201c;age of architecture.&#x201d;<br><br>On Norman Foster:<br>Norman Foster is the Mozart of modernism. He is nimble and prolific, and his buildings are marked by lightness and grace. He works very hard, but his designs don&#x2019;t show the effort. He brings an air of unnerving aplomb to everything he creates&#x2014;from skyscrapers to airports, research laboratories to art galleries, chairs to doorknobs. His ability to produce surprising work that doesn&#x2019;t feel labored must drive his competitors crazy.<br><br>On the Westin Hotel:<br>The forty-five-story Westin is the most garish tall building that has gone up in New York in as long as I can remember. It is fascinating, if only because it makes Times Square vulgar in a whole new way, extending up into the sky. It is not easy, these days, to go beyond the bounds of taste. If the architects, the Miami-based firm Arquitectonica, had been trying to allude to bad taste, one could perhaps respect what they came up with. But they simply wanted, like most architects today, to entertain us.<br><br>On Mies van der Rohe:<br>Mies&#x2019;s buildings look like the simplest things you could imagine, yet they are among the richest works of architecture ever created. Modern architecture was supposed to remake the world, and Mies was at the center of the revolution, but he was also a counterrevolutionary who designed beautiful things. His spare, minimalist objects are exquisite. He is the only modernist who created a language that ranks with the architectural languages of the past, and while this has sometimes been troubling for his reputation . . . his architectural forms become more astonishing as time goes on.</p><p>Pulitzer-prize winning journalist <b>Paul Goldberger</b> started his career at the <i>New York Times</i> and is currently the architecture critic for <i>The New Yorker</i> magazine.

His ability to produce surprising work that doesn't feel labored must drive his competitors crazy.<br><br>Foster, who is English and lives in London, is an artist with the savvy of a corporate consultant. He knows how to convince chief executives that the avant-garde is in their interest. In the 1980s, he persuaded HSBC, the international bank, to spend nearly a billion dollars to build a tower in Hong Kong; the novel structure, in which five enormous steel modules were stacked on top of one another, was the most innovative skyscraper since the Seagram Building. In 2000, he secured a commission from the Hearst Corporation, the publishing firm, to design its new headquarters, in Manhattan. The gorgeous, gemlike tower, which will officially open in a few months, is Foster's first big project in America.<br><br>In the 1920, William Randolph Hearst commissioned Joseph Urban to design his company's first headquarters: six stories of megalomaniacal pomp on Eighth Avenue between Fifty-sixth and Fifty-seventh Streets. Despite its low height, everything about the yellowish stone structure suggests grandiosity, especially the monumental fluted columns that stretch higher than the building itself, giving it the look of a base for a much taller structure. (Hearst and Urban had planned to add a tower, but they never did.) The Hearst Corporation long ago outgrew this zany palazzo, dispatching most of its employees to rented space nearby. When the company decided to gather its operations under one roof, its executives smartly concluded that Urban's building was too much fun to give up. Hearst hired Foster to build something on top of it, and in October 2001, he unveiled a scheme to add forty stories to the original headquarters. It was the first major construction project to be announced in New York after September 11.<br><br>As with all Foster designs, the Hearst tower is sleek, refined, and filled with new technology. It looks nothing like the Jazz Age confection on which it sits. The addition is sheathed in glass and stainless steel&#x2014;a shiny missile shooting out of Urban's stone launching pad. The tower's most prominent feature is the brash geometric pattern of its glass and steel, which the architect calls a "diagrid": a diagonal grid of supporting trusses, covering the facade with a series of four-story-high triangles. These make up much of the building's supporting structure, and they do it with impressive economy: the pattern uses 20 percent less steel than a conventional skyscraper frame would require.<br><br>Foster's brilliance can be seen in the way that he exploits this engineering trick for aesthetic pleasure. The triangles are the playful opposites of the dark Xs that slash the facade of the John Hancock Center, in Chicago. They give the building a jubilantly jagged shape. Foster started with a box, then sliced off the corners and ran triangles up and down the sides, pulling them in and out&#x2014;a gargantuan exercise in nip and tuck. The result resembles a many-faceted diamond. The corners of the shaft slant in and out as the tower rises, and the whole form shimmers.<br><br>Such a scheme could have become a pretentious exercise in structural exhibitionism, but in Foster's hands it presents the perfect foil for Urban's building. The design avoids the two most obvious approaches: imitating the style of the base or erecting a neutral glass box. Joseph Urban's goal in the original Hearst Building was to create a respectable form of flamboyance, and Foster has figured out how to do the same thing with his tower, but in unquestionably modern terms, and without compromising his commitment to structural innovation. Foster is at his best when solving puzzles like this one; unlike most elite architects, he isn't obsessed with creating his own pure forms. His gift for building a meaningful conversation between new and old architecture became apparent six years ago, with the unveiling of the renovated Reichstag, in Berlin: Foster placed a glass dome atop an ornate nineteenth-century masonry structure, reinterpreting the building's monumentality in modernist terms. And, in 2000, he enlivened the courtyard of the British Museum with a steel-and-glass canopy that casts a delicate geometric shadow on the floor.<br><br>In some ways, the Hearst tower calls to mind a famous unbuilt design from a heyday of modernism: a six-hundred-foot skyscraper in Philadelphia, proposed by Louis Kahn and Anne Tyng in 1957, which would have had a zigzag shape based on a framework of triangular supports. Kahn and Tyng weren't the only designers to have understood that the triangle is an inherently strong and efficient structural form; Buckminster Fuller and the engineer Robert Le Ricolais made the same claim. Foster's use of triangles is, in this sense, a borrowed notion. But most of the older schemes had the visual appeal of something made with an Erector set. Foster took the ideas, updated them, and produced not just a real building but an exceptionally elegant one.<br><br>Indeed, the Hearst tower is the most beautiful skyscraper to go up in New York since 1967, when Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill completed the stunningly serene 140 Broadway, in Lower Manhattan. After all the inchoate, collagelike skyscrapers that have been built around Times Square in the past decade, it's refreshing to see a tall building that clearly emerges from rational thought. Yet the Hearst tower also has a jauntiness that most modern buildings lack. The venerable modernist tradition of allowing a building's structure to determine its form has often led to pious, heavy-handed architecture. If you believe that there is something noble about a building expressing its structure, you will like the Hearst tower. But if you believe that it is more important for buildings to energize the skyline, you will like the Hearst tower every bit as much.<br><br>The pleasure of the Hearst tower doesn't end with the exterior. It has one of the most dramatic entrances of any tower in New York. You go in through Urban's original arch&#x2014;which, along with the rest of the base's exterior, has been meticulously restored&#x2014;and up a set of&nbsp; escalators. What comes next is an explosive surprise such as has not been seen in the city since Frank Lloyd Wright led people through a low, tight lobby into the rotunda of the Guggenheim. The escalators deposit you in a vast atrium that contains the upper floors of the old Urban building, which Foster has carved out and roofed over with glass. The inside walls of the old building have been covered with stucco, and you look up at three stories of windows&#x2014;something one rarely sees, except perhaps in a cathedral&#x2014;which give the space the feel of an outdoor piazza.<br><br>Hearst employees will be able to eat in a caf� within the atrium, and so will be on a par with their rivals at the Cond� Nast Building, in Times Square, which features a sensuous Frank Gehry&#x2013;designed cafeteria. But the Hearst space isn't just chic; it's majestic. The atrium is enhanced by huge, diagonal structural supports for the tower, which slice down into it, and skylights offer thrilling views of the tower rising directly above.<br><br>Unfortunately, it isn't easy to see the Hearst Building in the cityscape. It is blocked on the west by a banal brick apartment building, on the north by another apartment tower and, beyond that, by the new Time Warner Center, at Columbus Circle, which looks all the more uninspired in comparison. This situation isn't much different from that of most iconic New York skyscrapers, which are visible only in pieces. (The Empire State Building is a happy exception.) But the partial sightings of the Hearst Building that are offered up and down Eighth Avenue or along Fifty-seventh Street are so enticing that they end up increasing its allure&#x2014;like a flash of leg in a slit skirt. The best view comes from the Upper East Side, around the Metropolitan Museum, since nothing blocks the Hearst Building to the northeast. From the Met's roof, you can see the tower emerge in its full glory, rising over Central Park, at once fitting into New York's skyline and transforming it.<br><i><br>The New Yorker</i>, December 19, 2005</p><h2>Apple&#39;s America: The Discriminating Traveler&#39;s Guide to 40 Great Cities in the United States and Canada</h2><p><b>Unpretentious, sophisticated, and always appetizing advice from a celebrated authority</b><br><br>For more than thirty years, R.

He served sixteen years as Bureau Chief in Rome, Paris, and Moscow, where he received journalism awards as the year&#39;s best foreign correspondent for his coverage of the French North African War of 1955 and the Hungarian Revolution of 1956.Preface <p>YANK, The Army Weekly, was a phenomenon of World War II, which provided an insight into the nature of the American soldier that always will be valid. </p><p>The WWII man in uniform was no superman, no jingoist. He was no different from those who came before or after him. He endured the months of boredom and the moments of terror that are a soldier&#x2019;s fate. He suffered while at the same time he and his comrades persevered because his country was under attack, just as it was on September 11, 2001, that "nine-one-one" day when the comforting telephone number for emergency help took on a sinister reverse meaning. </p><p>YANK was the friend and colleague of the WWII soldier and was itself part of the enlisted U.S. Army. It let off soldier steam with "Mail Call" letters to the editor allowing troops to air their beefs at a global level. With its "What&#x2019;s Your Problem?" section providing frank, if not always the wished-for answers, it was a sort of secular chaplain. With its pinup pictures of gorgeous women back home, YANK spoke to the longings of young men who sometimes went months without seeing a woman. With its eyewitness staff reports of courage and death on battlefields around the world, the soldier weekly helped ease the strain of combat by sharing its very horror. </p><p>YANK violated all military and journalistic logic. With a circulation of 2,250,000 and a readership double that number created entirely by privates, corporals, and sergeants without officer intervention, YANK was a major morale instrument and propaganda device not controlled by lieutenants, captains, majors, colonels, or even generals&#x2014;which indeed flustered some of America&#x2019;s own generals, including the blood-and-guts Patton and the centralist MacArthur. </p><p>Caesar provided his own history of a "Gaul divided in three parts" and Britain&#x2019;s commander-in-chief Churchill recorded his particular version of World War II, but it was left to YANK&#x2019;s enlisted men to record America&#x2019;s own week-by-week diary of what the mid-twentieth century global war was like. YANK was the first periodical to achieve global publication. Faced with how to reach troops on six continents in timely fashion when transportation was scarce, slow, and imperiled, YANK&#x2019;s small staff set up 21 editions in 17 countries, the main magazine was edited in New York and a few pages were substituted locally. Army planes carried the main page forms to regional YANK editors and printers in Panama, England, Puerto Rico, Trinidad, Italy, China, Burma, Egypt, Iran, France, Strasbourg, India, Hawaii, Australia, Saipan, Okinawa, the Philippines, and even Japan. </p><p>The magazine&#x2019;s staff was part of the Army and had its own small share in the 1945 victory, along with the bombers, the artillery, the infantry, and the warships. Yet it was not the size of a division, nor a regiment, nor even a battalion. It was simply a military company with its single six-stripe first sergeant ruling from inside an office building on Manhattan&#x2019;s East 42nd Street. From there the sergeant&#x2019;s troops, answerable to him, fanned out across the planet to man bureaus often of a single soldier in Iceland, Nassau, Greenland, British Guiana, the Alcan Highway, Alaska, the Fiji Islands, New Guinea, the South Pacific, China, North Africa, Newfoundland, Iraq, Burma, and, in the case of one lucky corporal, Bermuda. </p><p>YANK was an official War Department publication and all but troops in combat had to pay to get it. The price was five cents or the local equivalent in a score of foreign currencies. The theory was that no one would read what he received for free. Unlike many other government documents, YANK was bought and read because it was believable. In a civilian Army, with all the indignities and frustrations of life under military discipline, it was accepted by the enlisted soldiers and sailors because its editors, writers, photographers, artists, and cartoonists shared the same lot and, if fortunate, bucked their same way up to more sleeve stripes of enlisted rank but never up to the gold shoulder bars of a second lieutenant. </p><p>YANK was designed at the very top of the American war effort by Secretary of War Henry Stimson and President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, as a way to let forcibly inducted civilians compare notes as they endured the separations and miseries of the war effort. One of the few times officers were allowed to contribute was when they spoke up in self-defense in the Mail Call replying to some subordinate&#x2019;s blast. </p><p>In an era of no television, one mission of the magazine was to entertain. In addition to the pinups there was always a page or more of cartoons, including Sergeant George Baker&#x2019;s "Sad Sack," the most hapless of the Army&#x2019;s perpetual privates. Sometimes with morbid humor the cartoonists, many of them non-staffers, laughed away soldier sorrows. </p><p>YANK&#x2019;s writers, artists, and cameramen went armed into combat, occasionally manning guns to assist in the battle. The weekly had its share of dead, wounded, and decorated. </p><p>YANK is unlikely to be repeated because only in a total mobilization would there be the talent pool from which to draw the staff and the audience of millions for them to address. For those on YANK able to continue their careers as writers, editors, and illustrators, and to do it uninhibitedly while wearing soldiers&#x2019; uniforms, was a sometimes terrifying, sometimes frustrating, often jubilant experience. Perhaps the generation YANK portrayed and within which it served may not have towered over all others as the greatest. With its patient courage and confidence reflected in YANK&#x2019;s pages, however, it set an example worth following. YANK filled its pages with great tales about World War II. As a result, it became one of the war&#x2019;s great stories.</p></p><h2>The Frigate Diana (Anatomy of the Ship)</h2><p>The eighteenth century equivalent of the cruiser, the frigate was used for a wide variety of roles from fleet reconnaissance to patrolling sea lanes. Built in 1793, Diana was a typical British frigate of the period, whose long and active career spanned virtually all of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. In 1815 she was sold to the Dutch navy, which she continued to serve until destroyed by an accidental fire in 1839. First published in 1987, this popular volume includes a new large-scale plan of the ship on the reverse of the extended fold-out jacket and over 100 perspective and three-dimensional drawings accompanied by in-depth descriptive keys and photos. Both accurate and impressively detailed, this volume is an essential reference for age of sail enthusiasts and modelers alike. 24 photographs. 300 line drawings.101/2 x 91/2 inches.</p><p></p><h2>Tassajara Bread Book</h2><p>Good bread needs more than just flour and water, milk, or eggs.

Using phenomenal research, she lays out why climate change is not an "issue"--it is a civilizational wake-up call, a powerful message delivered in the language of fires, floods, storms and droughts. Klein attacks the dominant economic policies of deregulated capitalism and endless resource extraction, and brilliantly identifies the threads that connect our failed responses to the crisis--from hard-core climate deniers to celebrity billionaires with messiah complexes, to the reckless quest to engineer the planet-<i>-and</i> she reveals how the "Big Green" environmental organizations may be hurting more than helping. She argues that we urgently need an entirely new model of human progress and shows why climate change--with its full economic and moral implications understood--is the most powerful weapon we have ever had in the fight for equality and social justice. Tracing the rise of a bold new resistance movement against extreme energy, she highlights the real solutions emerging in the rubble of our failed systems--solutions that require us to break virtually every rule in the free-market playbook.

A given amount of emission will lead to a given amount of temperature increase that will lead to a given amount of smooth incremental sea level rise. However, the geological record for the climate reflects instances where a relatively small change in one element of climate led to abrupt changes in the system as a whole. In other words, pushing global temperatures past certain thresholds could trigger abrupt, unpredictable and potentially irreversible changes that have massively disruptive and large-scale impacts. At that point, even if we do not add any additional CO2 to the atmosphere, potentially unstoppable processes are set in motion. We can think of this as sudden climate brake and steering failure where the problem and its consequences are no longer something we can control.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x2014;Report by the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the world&#x2019;s largest general scientific society, 20141<br> <br>&#x201c;I love that smell of the emissions.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x2014;Sarah Palin, 20112<br> <br>A voice came over the intercom: would the passengers of Flight 3935, scheduled to depart Washington, D.C., for Charleston, South Carolina, kindly collect their carry-on luggage and get off the plane.<br> <br>They went down the stairs and gathered on the hot tarmac. There they saw something unusual: the wheels of the US Airways jet had sunk into the black pavement as if it were wet cement. The wheels were lodged so deep, in fact, that the truck that came to tow the plane away couldn&#x2019;t pry it loose. The airline had hoped that without the added weight of the flight&#x2019;s thirty-five passengers, the aircraft would be light enough to pull. It wasn&#x2019;t. Someone posted a picture: &#x201c;Why is my flight cancelled? Because DC is so damn hot that our plane sank 4" into the pavement.&#x201d;3<br> <br>Eventually, a larger, more powerful vehicle was brought in to tow the plane and this time it worked; the plane finally took off, three hours behind schedule. A spokesperson for the airline blamed the incident on &#x201c;very unusual temperatures.&#x201d;4<br> <br>The temperatures in the summer of 2012 were indeed unusually hot. (As they were the year before and the year after.) And it&#x2019;s no mystery why this has been happening: the profligate burning of fossil fuels, the very thing that US Airways was bound and determined to do despite the inconvenience presented by a melting tarmac. This irony&#x2014;the fact that the burning of fossil fuels is so radically changing our climate that it is getting in the way of our capacity to burn fossil fuels&#x2014;did not stop the passengers of Flight 3935 from reembarking and continuing their journeys. Nor was climate change mentioned in any of the major news coverage of the incident.<br> <br>I am in no position to judge these passengers. All of us who live high consumer lifestyles, wherever we happen to reside, are, metaphorically, passengers on Flight 3935. Faced with a crisis that threatens our survival as a species, our entire culture is continuing to do the very thing that caused the crisis, only with an extra dose of elbow grease behind it. Like the airline bringing in a truck with a more powerful engine to tow that plane, the global economy is upping the ante from conventional sources of fossil fuels to even dirtier and more dangerous versions&#x2014;bitumen from the Alberta tar sands, oil from deepwater drilling, gas from hydraulic fracturing (fracking), coal from detonated mountains, and so on.<br> <br>Meanwhile, each supercharged natural disaster produces new irony-laden snapshots of a climate increasingly inhospitable to the very industries most responsible for its warming. Like the 2013 historic floods in Calgary that forced the head offices of the oil companies mining the Alberta tar sands to go dark and send their employees home, while a train carrying flammable petroleum products teetered on the edge of a disintegrating rail bridge. Or the drought that hit the Mississippi River one year earlier, pushing water levels so low that barges loaded with oil and coal were unable to move for days, while they waited for the Army Corps of Engineers to dredge a channel (they had to appropriate funds allocated to rebuild from the previous year&#x2019;s historic flooding along the same waterway). Or the coal-fired power plants in other parts of the country that were temporarily shut down because the waterways that they draw on to cool their machinery were either too hot or too dry (or, in some cases, both).<br> <br>Living with this kind of cognitive dissonance is simply part of being alive in this jarring moment in history, when a crisis we have been studiously ignoring is hitting us in the face&#x2014;and yet we are doubling down on the stuff that is causing the crisis in the first place.<br> <br>I denied climate change for longer than I care to admit. I knew it was happening, sure. Not like Donald Trump and the Tea Partiers going on about how the continued existence of winter proves it&#x2019;s all a hoax. But I stayed pretty hazy on the details and only skimmed most of the news stories, especially the really scary ones. I told myself the science was too complicated and that the environmentalists were dealing with it. And I continued to behave as if there was nothing wrong with the shiny card in my wallet attesting to my &#x201c;elite&#x201d; frequent flyer status.<br> <br>A great many of us engage in this kind of climate change denial. We look for a split second and then we look away. Or we look but then turn it into a joke (&#x201c;more signs of the Apocalypse!&#x201d;). Which is another way of looking away.<br> <br>Or we look but tell ourselves comforting stories about how humans are clever and will come up with a technological miracle that will safely suck the carbon out of the skies or magically turn down the heat of the sun. Which, I was to discover while researching this book, is yet another way of looking away.<br> <br>Or we look but try to be hyper-rational about it (&#x201c;dollar for dollar it&#x2019;s more efficient to focus on economic development than climate change, since wealth is the best protection from weather extremes&#x201d;)&#x2014;as if having a few more dollars will make much difference when your city is underwater. Which is a way of looking away if you happen to be a policy wonk.<br> <br>Or we look but tell ourselves we are too busy to care about something so distant and abstract&#x2014;even though we saw the water in the subways in New York City, and the people on their rooftops in New Orleans, and know that no one is safe, the most vulnerable least of all. And though perfectly understandable, this too is a way of looking away.<br> <br>Or we look but tell ourselves that all we can do is focus on ourselves. Meditate and shop at farmers&#x2019; markets and stop driving&#x2014;but forget trying to actually change the systems that are making the crisis inevitable because that&#x2019;s too much &#x201c;bad energy&#x201d; and it will never work. And at first it may appear as if we are looking, because many of these lifestyle changes are indeed part of the solution, but we still have one eye tightly shut.<br> <br>Or maybe we do look&#x2014;really look&#x2014;but then, inevitably, we seem to forget. Remember and then forget again. Climate change is like that; it&#x2019;s hard to keep it in your head for very long. We engage in this odd form of on-again-off-again ecological amnesia for perfectly rational reasons. We deny because we fear that letting in the full reality of this crisis will change everything. And we are right.5<br> <br>We know that if we continue on our current path of allowing emissions to rise year after year, climate change will change everything about our world. Major cities will very likely drown, ancient cultures will be swallowed by the seas, and there is a very high chance that our children will spend a great deal of their lives fleeing and recovering from vicious storms and extreme droughts. And we don&#x2019;t have to do anything to bring about this future. All we have to do is nothing. Just continue to do what we are doing now, whether it&#x2019;s counting on a techno-fix or tending to our gardens or telling ourselves we&#x2019;re unfortunately too busy to deal with it.<br> <br>All we have to do is not react as if this is a full-blown crisis. All we have to do is keep on denying how frightened we actually are. And then, bit by bit, we will have arrived at the place we most fear, the thing from which we have been averting our eyes. No additional effort required.<br> <br>There are ways of preventing this grim future, or at least making it a lot less dire. But the catch is that these also involve changing everything. For us high consumers, it involves changing how we live, how our economies function, even the stories we tell about our place on earth. The good news is that many of these changes are distinctly un-catastrophic. Many are downright exciting. But I didn&#x2019;t discover this for a long while.<br> <br>I remember the precise moment when I stopped averting my eyes to the reality of climate change, or at least when I first allowed my eyes to rest there for a good while. It was in Geneva, in April 2009, and I was meeting with Bolivia&#x2019;s ambassador to the World Trade Organization (WTO), who was then a surprisingly young woman named Ang�lica Navarro Llanos. Bolivia being a poor country with a small international budget, Navarro Llanos had recently taken on the climate portfolio in addition to her trade responsibilities. Over lunch in an empty Chinese restaurant, she explained to me (using chopsticks as props to make a graph of the global emission trajectory) that she saw climate change both as a terrible threat to her people&#x2014;but also an opportunity.<br> <br>A threat for the obvious reasons: Bolivia is extraordinarily dependent on glaciers for its drinking and irrigation water and those white-capped mountains that tower over its capital were turning gray and brown at an alarming rate. The opportunity, Navarro Llanos said, was that since countries like hers had done almost nothing to send emissions soaring, they were in a position to declare themselves &#x201c;climate creditors,&#x201d; owed money and technology support from the large emitters to defray the hefty costs of coping with more climate-related disasters, as well as to help them develop on a green energy path.<br> <br>She had recently given a speech at a United Nations climate conference in which she laid out the case for these kinds of wealth transfers, and she gave me a copy. &#x201c;Millions of people,&#x201d; it read, &#x201c;in small islands, least-developed countries, landlocked countries as well as vulnerable communities in Brazil, India and China, and all around the world&#x2014;are suffering from the effects of a problem to which they did not contribute.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. If we are to curb emissions in the next decade, we need a massive mobilization larger than any in history. We need a Marshall Plan for the Earth. This plan must mobilize financing and technology transfer on scales never seen before. It must get technology onto the ground in every country to ensure we reduce emissions while raising people&#x2019;s quality of life. We have only a decade.&#x201d;6<br> <br>Of course a Marshall Plan for the Earth would be very costly&#x2014;hundreds of billions if not trillions of dollars (Navarro Llanos was reluctant to name a figure). And one might have thought that the cost alone would make it a nonstarter&#x2014;after all, this was 2009 and the global financial crisis was in full swing. Yet the grinding logic of austerity&#x2014;passing on the bankers&#x2019; bills to the people in the form of public sector layoffs, school closures, and the like&#x2014;had not yet been normalized. So rather than making Navarro Llanos&#x2019;s ideas seem less plausible, the crisis had the opposite effect.<br> <br>We had all just watched as trillions of dollars were marshaled in a moment when our elites decided to declare a crisis. If the banks were allowed to fail, we were told, the rest of the economy would collapse. It was a matter of collective survival, so the money had to be found. In the process, some rather large fictions at the heart of our economic system were exposed (Need more money? Print some!). A few years earlier, governments took a similar approach to public finances after the September 11 terrorist attacks. In many Western countries, when it came to constructing the security/surveillance state at home and waging war abroad, budgets never seemed to be an issue.<br> <br>Climate change has never received the crisis treatment from our leaders, despite the fact that it carries the risk of destroying lives on a vastly greater scale than collapsed banks or collapsed buildings. The cuts to our greenhouse gas emissions that scientists tell us are necessary in order to greatly reduce the risk of catastrophe are treated as nothing more than gentle suggestions, actions that can be put off pretty much indefinitely. Clearly, what gets declared a crisis is an expression of power and priorities as much as hard facts. But we need not be spectators in all this: politicians aren&#x2019;t the only ones with the power to declare a crisis. Mass movements of regular people can declare one too.<br> <br>Slavery wasn&#x2019;t a crisis for British and American elites until abolitionism turned it into one. Racial discrimination wasn&#x2019;t a crisis until the civil rights movement turned it into one. Sex discrimination wasn&#x2019;t a crisis until feminism turned it into one. Apartheid wasn&#x2019;t a crisis until the anti-apartheid movement turned it into one.<br> <br>In the very same way, if enough of us stop looking away and decide that climate change is a crisis worthy of Marshall Plan levels of response, then it will become one, and the political class will have to respond, both by making resources available and by bending the free market rules that have proven so pliable when elite interests are in peril. We occasionally catch glimpses of this potential when a crisis puts climate change at the front of our minds for a while. &#x201c;Money is no object in this relief effort. Whatever money is needed for it will be spent,&#x201d; declared British prime minister David Cameron&#x2014;Mr. Austerity himself&#x2014;when large parts of his country were underwater from historic flooding in February 2014 and the public was enraged that his government was not doing more to help.7<br> <br>Listening to Navarro Llanos describe Bolivia&#x2019;s perspective, I began to understand how climate change&#x2014;if treated as a true planetary emergency akin to those rising flood waters&#x2014;could become a galvanizing force for humanity, leaving us all not just safer from extreme weather, but with societies that are safer and fairer in all kinds of other ways as well. The resources required to rapidly move away from fossil fuels and prepare for the coming heavy weather could pull huge swaths of humanity out of poverty, providing services now sorely lacking, from clean water to electricity. This is a vision of the future that goes beyond just surviving or enduring climate change, beyond &#x201c;mitigating&#x201d; and &#x201c;adapting&#x201d; to it in the grim language of the United Nations. It is a vision in which we collectively use the crisis to leap somewhere that seems, frankly, better than where we are right now.<br> <br>After that conversation, I found that I no longer feared immersing myself in the scientific reality of the climate threat. I stopped avoiding the articles and the scientific studies and read everything I could find. I also stopped outsourcing the problem to the environmentalists, stopped telling myself this was somebody else&#x2019;s issue, somebody else&#x2019;s job. And through conversations with others in the growing climate justice movement, I began to see all kinds of ways that climate change could become a catalyzing force for positive change&#x2014;how it could be the best argument progressi...</p><h2>Imperfect Justice: Looted Assets, Slave Labor, and the Unfinished Business of World War II</h2><p>Imperfect Justice is Stuart Eizenstat's personal account of how the Holocaust became a political and diplomatic battleground fifty years after the war's end, as the issues of dormant bank accounts, slave labor, confiscated property, looted art, and unpaid insurance policies convulsed Europe and America. His story is not one of easy successes or an idyllic view of justice. Rather, it is a revealing chronicle of high-stakes negotiations involving heads of European governments, played out on an international stage in an emotionally charged atmosphere, with a subtext of crimes against humanity and billions of dollars on the table.<br>Eizenstat recounts the often heated negotiations with the Swiss, the Germans, the French, the Austrians, and various Jewish organizations, showing how moral and legal issues shunted aside for so long, exposed wounds that had never healed and conflicts that had never been properly resolved. Each country responded in its own way: Switzerland fought the disclosures about its past and deeply resented the outside pressure it faced; Germany accepted that it was once again called upon to account for its wartime sins, this time for those committed by private industry; Austria was torn, seeing itself as both victim and collaborator with Hitler; and France courageously accepted national responsibility for the Vichy regime. And on the other side of the table were a remarkable cast of characters: class-action lawyers, some of whom were altruistic while others were as interested in their own press clippings as in serving the needs of the survivors they represented; Jewish organizations that were at each other's throats over who best represented the victims in their quest for justice; politicians with their own agendas and ambitions, including New York's colorful Senator Alfonse D'Amato, who turned the issue into his own personal crusade; and the President of the United States, Bill Clinton.</p><p>In the second half of the 1990s, Stuart Eizenstat had perhaps the most controversial assignment of any U.S. foreign policy official in Europe. His mission had nothing to do with Russia, the Middle East, Yugoslavia, or any of the other hotspots of the day.

Eizenstat's work has also laid the groundwork for resolving future disputes arising from man's inhumanity to man, proving that it is possible to bring justice, even imperfect justice, to an unjust world.</p>Stuart E. Eizenstat served as the U.S. Ambassador to the European Union, Under Secretary of Commerce, Under Secretary of State, and Deputy Secretary of the Treasury during the Clinton Administration, from 1993 to 2001.

An honors graduate of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and of Harvard Law School, he was also chief White House domestic policy adviser to President Jimmy Carter from 1977 to 1981. He is currently the head of international trade and finance at the law firm of Covington &amp; Burling in Washington, D.C., and serves on the boards of numerous corporate, academic, religious, and public policy institutions. He is married to Frances Eizenstat and they have two married sons, Jay and Brian, and four grandchildren.</p><h2>In the Balkans</h2><p>Collects the works of street photographer Nikos Economopoulos in the Balkan Peninsula, putting a human face on the warfare and annihilation that happens there every day</p><p>Like the news from Bosnia, the black-and-white photographs in this book are confusing and grim. Yet Economopoulos has photographed all over the Balkan Peninsula without finding differences demarcated by national borders; "the Balkan people," he writes, "have created their own curious identity, unique across ethnic borders, political divisions, and religious schisms." Nevertheless, they continue to annihilate one another in ethnic warfare. Economopoulos' photographs are long on style--a spontaneous documentary style that owes equal debts to Henri Cartier-Bresson and Gene Richards--and ask more questions than they answer. Economopoulos is not an "event" photographer but rather a "street" photographer, simply alert to what might happen visually, and his pictures never explain anything. They do, however, put a human face on the part of the world that consistently produces the day's worst news--achievement enough for any book. <i>Gretchen Garner</i></p><h2>Cupid</h2><p>During a visit to Earth, Cupid discovers that he has the power to make mortals fall in love and proceeds to get into all kinds of naughty mischief.</p><p>Babette Cole was born in Jersey in the Channel Islands. She graduated from Canterbury College of Art in 1973 and was the illustrator and author of more than 150 witty, imaginative, irreverent and thought-provoking picture books for children including the bestselling, stereotype-defying Princess Smartypants. She produced animated storyboards for the BBC and illustrated numerous greetings cards and books by other authors as well as her own. Babette adored the countryside and was a keen horse rider and breeder. She spent much of her life in Lincolnshire, before moving to Kent and then westward through Dorset, Devon and Cornwall.In the flippant, whimsical style familiar to Cole aficionados, the story of Cupid encompasses the reader in a world of gods come to earth. The obsession of Cupid's mother with beauty--and beauty pageants--drives the family down to earth so that she can enter the Miss World competition. The celestial couple take up residence on Mount Olympus Avenue and call themselves Mr. and Mrs. Jupiter-Jones. Meanwhile, their fun-loving offspring quickly learns that when his arrows meet their mark, hilarious results seem to follow. So Cupid entertains himself by making all sorts of diverse types fall for each other: two grumps on a park bench embrace passionately, an equestrian becomes engaged to her horse and a couple with enormous noses fall in love even though their lips can never meet. Finally "some very bad men" notice that Cupid is the son of Miss World (Cupid's arrows influenced the judges' decision) and kidnap him for ransom. Clever Cupid quickly escapes and makes an exercise class of porcine beauties fall in love with the malefactors. Cole's unique brand of wacky humor is given free reign in this merry romp--not to be confused with Hamilton's Mythology . A lighthearted book perfect for Valentine's Day.

Through a series of captivating and sophisticated illustrated stories, Tan explores the precious strangeness of our existence. He gives us a portrait of modern suburban existence filtered through a wickedly Monty Pythonesque lens. Whether it&#x2019;s discovering that the world really does stop at the end of the city&#x2019;s map book, or a family&#x2019;s lesson in tolerance through an alien cultural exchange student, Tan&#x2019;s deft, sweet social satire brings us face-to-face with the humor and absurdity of modern life.</p><p>Shaun Tan has been illustrating young adult fiction and picture books for more than ten years. His brilliant wordless book, <b>The Arrival</b>, won The CBCA Picture Book of the Year, The NSW Premier&#x2019;s Book of the Year, and the Community Relations Commission Award, and received a Special Mention at the 2007 Bologna Ragazzi Awards. <br>He lives in Australia.<b>Stick Figures</b><br><br>If they are standing in the middle of the street, it&#x2019;s easy enough to drive around them, as you would a piece of cardboard or a dead cat. Turning your sprinklers on will discourage them from hanging around the front of your house; loud music and smoke from barbecues will also keep them away. They are not a problem, just another part of the suburban landscape, their brittle legs moving as slowly as clouds. They have always been here, since before anyone remembers, since before the bush was cleared and all the houses were built.<br><br>Adults pay them little attention. Young children sometimes dress them in old clothes and hats as if they were dolls or scarecrows, and are always scolded by parents, whose reasons are unclear. &#x2018;Just don&#x2019;t,&#x2019; they say sternly.<br><br>Some older boys take great delight in beating them with baseball bats, golf clubs, or whatever is at hand, including the victim&#x2019;s own snapped-off limbs. With careful aim a good strike will send the head &#x2014; a faceless clod of earth &#x2014; flying high into the air. The body remains passively upright until smashed to splinters between heels and asphalt.<br><br>This can go on for hours, depending on how many the boys can find. But eventually it stops being amusing. It becomes boring, somehow enraging, the way they just stand there and take it. What are they? Why are they here? What do they want? Whack! Whack! Whack! <br><br>The only response is the sound of dead branches falling from old trees on windless evenings, and random holes appearing in front lawns, dark sockets where clods of earth have been removed during the night. And sure enough there they are again, standing by fences and driveways, in alleyways and parks, silent sentinels.<br><br>Are they here for a reason? It&#x2019;s impossible to know, but if you stop and stare at them for a long time, you can imagine that they too might be searching for answers, for some kind of meaning. It&#x2019;s as if they take all our questions and offer them straight back: Who are you? Why are you here? What do you want?<br><b>The Nameless holiday</b><br><br>The nameless holiday happens once a year, usually around late August, sometimes October. It is always anticipated by children and adults alike with mixed emotion: it&#x2019;s not exactly festive, but still a celebration of sorts, the origin of which has been long forgotten.<br><br>All that is known are the familiar rituals: the laying out of one&#x2019;s most prized possessions on the bedroom floor; then choosing one special object &#x2014; exactly the right one &#x2014; and carrying it carefully up a ladder to the roof and leaving it under the TV aerial (already decorated with small shiny things such as chocolate wrappers, old CDs, and the tops off tubs of yoghurt, licked clean and threaded with string, tied with special slip-knots).<br><br>Then there is the traditional midnight picnic in the backyard, front lawn, or any place with a good view of one&#x2019;s own roof &#x2014; across the street if necessary, which is why families sometimes gather by the roadside on blankets. Here are born fond memories of freshly baked gingerbread crows, hot pomegranate juice as tart as a knife and small plastic whistles, inaudible to the ears of both humans and dogs. Not to mention all that excited chatter and giggling, all that polite shushing, everyone struggling to observe the convention of silence.<br><br>Those who stay awake long enough are rewarded by a momentary sound that never fails to draw a sharp intake of breath &#x2014; the delicate tapping of hoofs descending on roof tiles. It is always so startling, so hard to believe at first, like a waking dream or a rumour made solid. But sure enough, there he is, the reindeer with no name: enormous, blind as a bat, sniffing under the TV aerial with infinite animal patience. He always knows exactly which objects are so loved that their loss will be felt like the snapping of a cord to the heart, and it&#x2019;s only these that he nudges tenderly until they become hooked onto his great antlers. The rest he leaves alone, leaping gracefully back up into the cool darkness.<br><br>What a remarkable, unnameable feeling it is, right at the moment of his leaping: something like sadness and regret, of suddenly wanting your gift back and held tight to your chest, knowing that you will certainly never see it again. And then there is the letting go as your muscles release, your lungs exhale, and the backwash of longing leaves behind this one image on the shore of memory: a huge reindeer on your roof, bowing down.</p><h2>Question Everything: 132 Science Questions - And Their Unexpected Answers (New Scientist)</h2><p>The latest in the bestselling new scientist last word series all science begins with questions... - why is the night sky black, even though it&#39;s full of stars? - how do pebbles skim on water? - why doesn&#39;t your own snoring wake you up? - and why is the large hadron collider so ...

Lovecraft (1890-1937), a Providence author considered by many to be the finest horror story writer of the twentieth century. Lovecraft's tales are a blend of fantasy, science fiction, and horror, with the latter being especially prominent. His tales describe a pantheon of powerful beings known as the Great Old Ones. </p><p>Since Lovecraft's time the Cthulhu Mythos has grown exponentially, until it has become increasingly difficult to keep track of, even for devoted fans. Many writers have contributed to it, including Robert E. Howard, Robert Bloch, Brian Lumley, and Stephen King. This book is the first major attempt in many years to provide a comprehensive guide to H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos. </p><p>The second edition of Encyclopedia Cthulhiana contains over a hundred and fifty additional pages and scores of new entries. New features includes thumbnail illustrations of the most important signs and symbols (see sample, left) and a timeline of the Cthulhu Mythos spanning billions of years. Many entries have been revised to reflect our latest understanding of the Mythos, and the infamous Necronomicon appendix has been greatly expanded. Also present for the first time is "A Brief History of the Cthulhu Mythos", which examines the evolution of the genre from the 1920s to today. </p><p>A Great Resource for Call of Cthulhu players! </p><p>This book is part of an expanding collection of Cthulhu Mythos horror fiction and related topics. Call of Cthulhu fiction focuses on single entities, concepts, or authors significant to readers and fans of H.P. Lovecraft.</p></p><p>You just found out that you've inherited a copy of Reverend Winter-Hall's translation of the Sussex Manuscript. (What is it? Is it dangerous?)

Dahl seems to know just how far to go with his oddball fantasies; in <i>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,</i> for example, nasty Violet Beauregarde blows up into a blueberry from sneaking forbidden chewing gum, and bratty Augustus Gloop is carried away on the river of chocolate he wouldn't resist. In fact, all manner of disasters can happen to the most obnoxiously deserving of children because Dahl portrays each incident with such resourcefulness and humor. <p> <i>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</i> is a singular delight, crammed with mad fantasy, childhood justice and revenge, and as much candy as you can eat. The book is also available in Spanish (<i>Charlie y la Fabrica de Chocolate</i>). (The suggested age range for this book is 9-12, but nobody this reviewer has met can resist it, including New York City bellhops, flight attendants, and grumpy teenagers.)</p>What happens when the five luckiest children in the entire world walk through the doors of Willy Wonka&#39;s famous, mysterious chocolate factory?

After years of smartly dissecting our games at their highest levels in bestsellers like <i>The Majors</i>, <i>A Good Walk Spoiled</i>, and <i>A Season on the Brink</i>, he returns to dissecting our games at their <i>purest</i> level, ground he first staked out quite stirringly in <i>A Civil War</i>, his chronicle of Army-Navy football. <p> In <i>The Last Amateurs</i>, he mines the 1999-2000 season of Patriot League basketball. Given the high-stakes, high-profile, and often dirty world of college hoops these days, Feinstein comes up with a remarkably refreshing place to visit, a sporting environment short on scandals, prima donnas, and sneaker contracts, but long on a pure passion for the game that complements achievement in the classroom. In the league's seven schools--Bucknell, Lehigh, Lafayette, Colgate, Holy Cross, Army, and Navy--academics come first, the hardwood second. These are campuses populated by students who happen to be athletes, not athletes stopping off on the way to lucrative careers in professional sports. Indeed, these are young athletes who have their post-college focus on the rest of their lives, not the NBA. Sports, for them, builds character, not bank accounts.</p><p> Still, the Patriot League is a Division I conference, with its champion earning an automatic berth in the NCAA tournament. It takes the games seriously--often, as Feinstein reveals, heartbreakingly so--even if it doesn't necessarily play to ACC, SEC, Big 10, and Pac-10 standards. Feinstein's interviewing, skillful as ever, brings the players, coaches, and administrators of the colleges in this league to full form, making <i>The Last Amateurs</i> a rarity among sports books--a smart volume about smart people with their heads and priorities pointed in the right direction. Like the conference itself, it's in a league of its own. --<i>Jeff Silverman</i></p>John Feinstein is an American sportswriter and commentator. He is a columnist for the Washington Post, an author, is a guest commentator on NPR, and does color commentary for United States Naval Academy football games. He is also a frequent contributor to The Tony Kornheiser Show. During a radio broadcast of the football game between the Naval Academy and Duke University on October 1, 2005, Feinstein blurted an obscenity over-the-air in response to what he perceived to be a bad call on the field. He immediately removed himself from the rest of the broadcast, except to return at the end to apologize on the air. Although he offered his resignation to the Naval Academy, they rejected it because of his contrition and have invited him to continue to participate in future broadcasts. Feinstein was a sports writer for the The Chronicle while enrolled at Duke University, where he graduated in 1977. One of Feinstein&#39;s nicknames is &#34;Junior&#34;, despite not having the suffix in his name. The name was given by Tony Kornheiser because of the similarities in his temper to John McEnroe. Feinstein sometimes fills in as a guest host on The Jim Rome Show. Rome considers Feinstein to be one of the most intelligent people he&#39;s interviewed on the show, and occasionally teases him about an over-the-phone interview that was interrupted by Feinstein&#39;s daughter.</p><h2>Man Seeks God: My Flirtations with the Divine</h2><p>When a health scare puts him in the hospital, Eric Weiner-an agnostic by default-finds himself tangling with an unexpected question, posed to him by a well-meaning nurse. <i>"Have you found your God yet?"<b> </b></i>The thought of it nags him, and prods him-and ultimately launches him on a far-flung journey to do just that. <br><br> Weiner, a longtime "spiritual voyeur" and inveterate traveler, realizes that while he has been privy to a wide range of religious practices, he's never seriously considered these concepts in his own life. Face to face with his own mortality, and spurred on by the question of what spiritual principles to impart to his young daughter, he decides to correct this omission, undertaking a worldwide exploration of religions and hoping to come, if he can, to a personal understanding of the divine. <br><br> The journey that results is rich in insight, humor, and heart. Willing to do anything to better understand faith, and to find the god or gods that speak to him, he travels to Nepal, where he meditates with Tibetan lamas and a guy named Wayne. He sojourns to Turkey, where he whirls (not so well, as it turns out) with Sufi dervishes. He heads to China, where he attempts to unblock his <i>chi; </i>to Israel, where he studies Kabbalah, <i>sans</i> Madonna; and to Las Vegas, where he has a close encounter with Raelians (followers of the world's largest UFO-based religion).<br><br> At each stop along the way, Weiner tackles our most pressing spiritual questions: Where do we come from? What happens when we die? How should we live our lives? Where do all the missing socks go? With his trademark wit and warmth, he leaves no stone unturned. At a time when more Americans than ever are choosing a new faith, and when spiritual questions loom large in the modern age, <b>MAN SEEKS GOD</b> presents a perspective on religion that is sure to delight, inspire, and entertain.<br><br></p><p>Eric Weiner is author of the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <em>The Geography of Bliss</em>, which has been translated into eighteen languages.

Much of the power of this pilgrimage comes from the characters Weiner encounters-informed, impassioned, and idiosyncratic guides who lead the ever-questioning, ever-doubting author on a magical mystery tour that illuminates our inner and outer paths."&#x2015;<b><i><i>National Geographic Traveler </i></i></b><br><br>"I came to Eric Weiner's MAN SEEKS GOD looking for a fight. But in the end, I didn't find the fight I was looking for; instead, I found an affable, candid, deeply thoughtful, sometimes ironic and funny soul, with whom I shared certain similarities.... In the end, despite my proclivity for theological fisticuffs, Mr. Weiner's candor and thoughtfulness were entirely disarming. Whereas some people spend a lifetime searching for their god, Mr. Weiner's whirlwind speed-dating of deities is a thing to behold. I came to admire Mr. Weiner's tenacity and verve, trotting off to places I'll likely never go -- at least not for the same reasons -- pursuing and spending long hours with the kinds of people I'll likely only meet in passing, all in an effort to better understand the world and himself and to 'find his God.'"&#x2015;<b><i><i>Pittsburgh Post Gazette</i></i></b><br><br>"Winsome, self-deprecating humor marks every page."<br>&#x2015;<b><i><i>Publishers Weekly</i></i></b><br><br>"Well-researched, informative and engaging, MAN SEEKS GOD is packed with facts and wisdom that, regardless of which God you root for, will leave what a Buddhist friend of Weiner's calls 'Post-it Notes on the brain.'"<br>&#x2015;<b><i><i>Washington Post</i></i></b><br><br>"It is not so much the various religions and religious practices examined that make MAN SEEKS GOD compelling, but the people Weiner encounters and spends time with as he travels around the world in search of something to fill the proverbial 'God shaped hole.'...[an] honest and neurotic, generally entertaining book."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Bookreporter.com</i></i></b><br><br>"Writing about spirituality is fraught with ironies: Isn't the divine supposed to be beyond words? How to describe the inner landscape without sounding insane or precious?

An Audie� Award-winner, Vance was recently named "The Voice of Choice" by <i>Booklist</i> magazine.Gardner rouses himself for more elaborate plotting than usual in his tenth stint as Ian Fleming's stand-in, but Gardner's James Bond, on loan to the KGB for some antiterrorist housecleaning, has aged a lot less gracefully than Sean Connery. A dissident Russian cabal calling itself The Scales of Justice (SoJ) has kidnapped somebody it claims is Josif Vorontsov, notorious second-in-command at Babi Yar, from his home in New Jersey and threatened to assassinate high-level brass hats until the government takes Vorontsov off their hands and places him on trial for war crimes. When the Kremlin denies that SoJ has the real Vorontsov and refuses to recognize his extradition, SoJ begins taking out high-level brass hats, and the KGB asks British Intelligence to let them have somebody--guess who--able to infiltrate SoJ by substituting for two English-speaking recruits. Gardner lays some promising trails--Bond working for the KGB, Bond partnered by Mossad agent Pete Natkowitz, two interloping French agents (one a natural bedmate), the news that SoJ intends to videotape its own free-lance war-crimes trial, and all the usual seductions, killings, double-crosses, flashbacks, and intimations of The End (this time by hard-liners bombing Washington while the US is busy bombing Baghdad)--but the going keeps getting muddier, as if somebody else had finished the book over a third martini (shaken, not stirred). Bond saves the world, gets the woman and the Order of Lenin, and turns in a less muffled performance than in last year's Brokenclaw, though still below average for Gardner's series. Let's not talk about how far below Fleming's average. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

A first novel. 40,000 first printing.</p><p><b>Stef Penney</b> was born and grew up in Edinburgh. After earning a degree in philosophy and theology from Bristol University, she turned to filmmaking, studying film and TV at Bournemouth College of Art. On graduation she was selected for the Carlton Television New Writers Scheme. She is a screenwriter. <i>The Tenderness of Wolves</i> is her first novel.The last time I saw Laurent Jammet, he was in Scott's store with a dead wolf over his shoulder. I had gone to get needles, and he had come in for the bounty. Scott insisted on the whole carcass, having once been bamboozled by a Yankee who brought in a pair of ears one day and claimed his bounty, then some time later brought in the paws for another dollar, and finally the tail. It was winter and the parts looked fairly fresh, but the con became common knowledge, to Scott's disgust. So the wolf's face was the first thing I saw when I walked in. The tongue lolled out of the mouth, which was pulled back in a grimace. I flinched, despite myself. Scott yelled and Jammet apologized profusely; it was impossible to be angry with him, what with his charm and his limp. The carcass was removed out back somewhere, and as I was browsing, they began to argue about the moth-eaten pelt that hangs over the door. I think Jammet suggested jokingly that Scott replace it with a new one. The sign under it reads, "Canis lupus (male), the first wolf to be caught in the town of Caulfield, 11th February, 1860." The sign tells you a lot about John Scott, demonstrating his pretensions to learning, his self-importance, and the craven respect for authority over truth. It certainly wasn't the first wolf to be caught around here, and there is no such thing as the town of Caulfield, strictly speaking, although he would like there to be, because then there would be a council, and he could be its mayor.<p>"Anyway, that is a female. Males have a darker collar, and are bigger. This one is very small."</p><p>Jammet knew what he was talking about, as he had caught more wolves than anyone else I know. He smiled, to show he meant no offense, but Scott takes offense like it is going out of fashion, and bristled.</p><p>"I suppose you remember better than I do, Mr. Jammet?"</p><p>Jammet shrugged. Since he wasn't here in 1860, and since he was French, unlike the rest of us, he had to watch his step.</p><p>At this point I stepped up to the counter. "I think it was a female, Mr. Scott. The man who brought it in said her cubs howled all night. I remember it distinctly."</p><p>And the way Scott strung up the carcass by its back legs outside the store for everyone to gawp at. I had never seen a wolf before, and I was surprised at its smallness. It hung with its nose pointing at the ground, eyes closed as if ashamed. Men mocked the carcass, and children laughed, daring each other to put their hands in its mouth. They posed with it for each other's amusement.</p><p>Scott turned tiny, bright blue eyes on me, either affronted that I should side with a foreigner, or just affronted, it was hard to tell.</p><p>"And look what happened to him." Doc Wade, the man who brought in the bounty, drowned the following spring -- as though that threw his judgment into question.</p><p>"Ah, well..." Jammet shrugged and winked at me, the cheek.</p><p>Somehow -- I think Scott mentioned it first -- we got talking about those poor girls, as people usually do when the subject of wolves is raised. Although there are any number of unfortunate females in the world (plenty in my experience alone), around here "those poor girls" always refers to only two -- the Seton sisters, who vanished all those years ago. There were a few minutes' pleasant and pointless exchange of views that broke off suddenly when the bell rang and Mrs. Knox came in. We pretended to be very interested in the buttons on the counter. Laurent Jammet took his dollar, bowed to me and Mrs. Knox, and left. The bell jangled on its metal spring for a long time after he walked out.</p><p>That was all, nothing significant about it. The last time I saw him.</p><p>Laurent Jammet was our closest neighbor. Despite this, his life was a mystery to us. I used to wonder how he hunted wolves with his bad leg, and then someone told me that he baited deer meat with strychnine. The skill came in following the trail to the resulting corpse. I don't know, though; that is not hunting as I see it. I know wolves have learned to stay out of range of a Winchester rifle, so they cannot be entirely stupid, but they are not so clever that they have learned to distrust a free gift of food, and where is the merit in following a doomed creature to its end? There were other unusual things about him: long trips away from home in parts unknown; visits from dark, taciturn strangers; and brief displays of startling generosity, in sharp counterpoint to his dilapidated cabin. We knew that he was from Quebec. We knew that he was Catholic, although he did not often go to church or to confession (though he may have indulged in both during his long absences). He was polite and cheerful, although he did not have particular friends, and kept a certain distance. And he was, I daresay, handsome, with almost-black hair and eyes, and features that gave the impression of having just finished smiling, or being just about to start. He treated all women with the same respectful charm, but managed not to irritate either them or their husbands. He was not married and showed no inclination to do so, but I have noticed that some men are happier on their own, especially if they are rather slovenly and irregular in their habits.</p><p>Some people attract an idle and entirely unmalicious envy. Jammet was one of those, lazy and good-natured, who seem to slide through life without toil or effort. I thought him lucky, because he did not seem to worry about those things that turn the rest of us gray. He had no gray hairs, but he had a past, which he kept mostly to himself. He imagined himself to have a future, too, I suppose, but he did not. He was perhaps forty. It was as old as he would ever get.</p><p>It is a Thursday morning in mid-November, about two weeks after that meeting in the store. I walk down the road from our house in a dreadful temper, planning my lecture carefully. More than likely I rehearse it aloud -- one of many strange habits that are all too easy to pick up in the backwoods. The road -- actually little more than a series of ruts worn by hooves and wheels -- follows the river where it plunges down a series of shallow falls. Under the birches patches of moss gleam emerald in the sunlight. Fallen leaves, crystallized by the night's frost, crackle under my feet, whispering of the coming winter. The sky is an achingly clear blue. I walk quickly in my anger, head high. It probably makes me look cheerful.</p><p>Jammet's cabin sits away from the riverbank in a patch of weeds that passes for a garden. The unpeeled log walls have faded over the years until the whole thing looks gray and woolly, more like a living growth than a building. It is something from a bygone age: the door is buckskin stretched over a wooden frame, the windows glazed with oiled parchment. In winter he must freeze. It's not a place where the women of Dove River often call, and I haven't been here myself for months, but right now I have run out of places to look.</p><p>There is no smoke signal of life inside, but the door stands ajar; the buckskin stained from earthy hands. I call out, then knock on the wall. There is no reply, so I peer inside, and when my eyes have adjusted to the dimness I see Jammet, at home and, true to form, asleep on his bed at this time in the morning. I nearly walk away then, thinking there is no point waking him, but frustration makes me persevere. I haven't come all this way for nothing.</p><p>"Mr. Jammet?" I start off, sounding, to my mind, irritatingly bright. "Mr. Jammet, I am sorry to disturb you, but I must ask..."</p><p>Laurent Jammet sleeps peacefully. Around his neck is the red neckerchief he wears for hunting, so that other hunters will not mistake him for a bear and shoot him. One foot protrudes off the side of the bed, in a dirty sock. His red neckerchief is on the table...I have grasped the side of the door. Suddenly, from being normal, everything has changed completely: flies hover around their late autumn feast; the red neckerchief is not around his neck, it cannot be, because it is on the table, and that means...</p><p>"Oh," I say, and the sound shocks me in the silent cabin. "No."</p><p>I cling on to the door, trying not to run away, although I realize a second later I couldn't move if my life depended on it.</p><p>The redness around his neck has leaked into the mattress from a gash. A gash. I'm panting, as though I've been running. The door frame is the most important thing in the world right now. Without it, I don't know what I would do.</p><p>The neckerchief has not done its duty. It has failed to prevent his untimely death.</p><p>I don't pretend to be particularly brave, and, in fact, long ago gave up the notion that I have any remarkable qualities, but I am surprised at the calmness with which I look around the cabin. My first thought is that Jammet has destroyed himself, but Jammet's hands are empty, and there is no sign of a weapon near him. One hand dangles off the side of the bed. It does not occur to me to be afraid. I know with absolute certainty that whoever did this is nowhere near -- the cabin proclaims its emptiness. Even the body on the bed is empty. There are no attributes to it now -- the cheerfulness and slovenliness and skill at shooting, the generosity and callousness -- they have all gone.</p><p>There is one other thing I can't help but notice, as his face is turned slightly away from me. I don't want to see it, but it's there, and it confirms what I have already unwillingly accepted -- that among all the things in the world that can never be known, Laurent Jammet's fate is not one of them. This is no accident, nor is it self-destruction. He has been scalped.</p><p>At length, although it is probably only a few seconds later, I pull the door closed behind me, and when I can't see him anymore, I feel better. Although for the rest of that day, and for days after, my right hand aches from the violence with which I gripped the door frame, as though I had been trying to knead the wood between my fingers, like dough.Copyright � 2006 by Stef Penney</p></p><h2>Twelve Steps to a Compassionate Life</h2><p>Karen Armstrong explains how to practise the religion of compassion that her last books have preached.<br><br>In November 2009 Armstrong and TED launched The Charter of Compassion, which states that "We call upon all men and women to restore compassion to the centre of morality and religion...to cultivate an informed empathy with the suffering of all human beings &#x2014; even those regarded as enemies."

We are trying to retrain our responses and form mental habits that are kinder, gentler, and less fearful of others. Reading and learning about compassion will be an important part of the process and should become a lifetime habit, but it does not stop there. You cannot learn to drive by reading the car manual; you have to get into the vehicle and practice manipulating it until the skills you acquire so laboriously become second nature. You cannot learn to swim by sitting on the side of the pool watching others cavort in the water; you have to take the plunge and learn to float. If you persevere, you will acquire an ability that at first seemed impossible. It is the same with compassion; we can learn about the neurological makeup of the brain and the requirements of our tradition, but until and unless we actually modify our behavior and learn to think and act toward others in accordance with the Golden Rule, we will make no progress.<br>&nbsp;<br>As an initial step, it might be helpful as a symbolic act of commitment to visit www.charterforcompassion.org and register with the Charter for Compassion. The charter is essentially a summons to compassionate action, and the website will enable you to keep up, week by week, with the charter&#x2019;s progress in various parts of the world. But the charter was a joint document that does not reflect the vision of a particular tradition, so it is important to integrate it with a mythos that will motivate you. No teaching that is simply a list of directives can be effective. We need inspiration and motivation that reach a level of the mind that is deeper than the purely rational and touch the emotions rooted in the limbic region of the brain. It is therefore important to explore your own tradition, be it religious or secular, and seek out its teaching about compassion. This will speak to you in a way that is familiar; resonate with some of your deepest aspirations, hopes, and fears; and explain what this journey toward compassion will entail.<br>&nbsp;<br>In the Suggestions for Further Reading at the back of the book, you will find titles that will help you expand your knowledge about your own and other people&#x2019;s traditions. You might find it useful to form a reading discussion group with whom you can go through the twelve steps. It might be interesting to include people from different religious and secular traditions, since the comparative study of other faiths and ideologies can enrich your understanding of your own. You might also like to keep a private anthology of passages or poems that you find particularly inspiring and make notes of what you have learned about the mythos that introduces us to the deeper meaning of compassion.<br>&nbsp;<br>The concept of mythology needs explanation because in our modern scientific world it has lost much of its original force. A myth is not a fanciful fairy tale. In popular speech the word &#x201c;myth&#x201d; is often used to describe something that is simply not true. Accused of a peccadillo in his past life, a politician is likely to protest that the story is a myth&#x2014;that it didn&#x2019;t happen. But in the premodern world, the purpose of myth was not to impart factual or historical information. The Greek <i>mythos </i>derives from the verb <i>musteion, </i>&#x201c;to close the mouth or the eyes.&#x201d; It is associated with silence, obscurity, and darkness. A myth was an attempt to express some of the more elusive aspects of life that cannot easily be expressed in logical, discursive speech. A myth is <i>more </i>than history; it is an attempt to explain the deeper significance of an event. A myth has been well described as something that in some sense happened once&#x2014;but that also happens all the time. It is about timeless, universal truth.<br>&nbsp;<br>If somebody had asked the ancient Greeks whether they believed that there was sufficient historical evidence for the famous story of Demeter, goddess of harvest and grain, and her beloved daughter, Persephone (Was Persephone really abducted by Hades and imprisoned in the underworld? Did Demeter truly secure her release? How could you prove that Persephone returned to the upper world each year?), they would have found these questions obtuse. The truth of the myth, they might have replied, was evident for all to see: it was clear in the way that the world came to life each spring, in the recurrent burgeoning of the harvest, and, above all, in the profound truth that death and life are inseparable. There is no new life if the seed does not go down into the ground and die; you cannot have life without death. The rituals associated with the myth, which were performed annually at Eleusis (where Demeter is said to have stayed during her search for Persephone), were carefully crafted to help people accept their mortality; afterward many found that they could contemplate the prospect of their own death with greater equanimity.1<br>&nbsp;<br>A myth, therefore, makes sense only if it is translated into action&#x2014;either ritually or behaviorally. It is comprehensible only if it is imparted as part of a process of transformation. 2 Myth has been aptly described as an early form of psychology. The tales about gods threading their way through labyrinths or fighting with monsters were describing an archetypal truth rather than an actual occurrence. Their purpose was to introduce the audience to the labyrinthine world of the psyche, showing them how to negotiate this mysterious realm and grapple with their own demons. The myth of the hero told people what they had to do to unlock their own heroic potential. When Sigmund Freud and C. G. Jung charted their modern scientific exploration of the psyche, they turned instinctively to these ancient narratives. A myth could put you in the correct spiritual posture, but it was up to you to take the next step. In our scientifically oriented world, we look for solid information and have lost the older art of interpreting these emblematic stories of gods walking out of tombs or seas splitting asunder, and this has made religion problematic. Without practical implementation, a myth can remain as opaque and abstract as the rules of a board game, which sound complicated and dull until you pick up the dice and start to play; then everything immediately falls into place and makes sense. As we go through the steps, we will examine some of the traditional myths to discover what they teach about the compassionate imperative&#x2014;and how we must act in order to integrate them with our own lives.<br>&nbsp;<br>It is not possible here to give an exhaustive account of the teachings of all the major traditions. I have had to concentrate on a few of the seminal prophets and sages who developed this ethos. But this brief overview can give us some idea of the universality of the compassionate ideal and the circumstances in which it came to birth.<br>&nbsp;<br>We have seen that there are brain mechanisms and hormones that induce such positive emotions as love, compassion, gratitude, and forgiveness but that they are not as powerful as the more primitive instinctual reflexes known as the Four Fs located in our reptilian old brain. But the great sages understood that it was possible to reorient the mind, and by putting some distance between their thinking selves and these potentially destructive instincts they found new peace. They did not come to this insight on lonely mountaintops or in desert fastnesses. They were all living in societies not unlike our own, which witnessed intense political conflict and fundamental social change. In every case, the catalyst for major spiritual change was a principled revulsion from the violence that had reached unprecedented heights as a result of this upheaval.3 These new spiritualities came into being at a time when the old brain was being co-opted by the calculating, rational new brain in ways that were exciting and life-enhancing but that many found profoundly disturbing.<br>&nbsp;<br>For millennia, human beings had lived in small isolated groups and tribes, using their rational powers to organize their society efficiently. At a time when survival depended on the sharing of limited resources, a reputation for altruism and generosity as well as physical strength and wisdom may well have been valued in a tribal leader. If you had not shared your resources in a time of plenty, who would help you and your people in your hour of need? The clan would survive only if members subordinated their personal desires to the requirements of the group and were ready to lay down their lives for the sake of the whole community. It was necessary for humans to become a positive presence in the minds of others, even when they were absent.4 It was important to elicit affection and concern in other members of the tribe so that they would come back and search for you if you were lost or wounded during a hunting expedition. But the Four Fs were also crucial to the tribal ethos, as essential for the group as for the individual. Hence tribalism often exhibited an aggressive territorialism, desire for status, reflexive loyalty to the leader and the group, suspicion of outsiders, and a ruthless determination to acquire more and more resources, even if this meant that other groups would starve. Tribalism was probably essential to the survival of <i>Homo sapiens, </i>but it could become problematic when human beings acquired the technology to make deadlier weapons and began to compete for territory and resources on a larger scale. It did not disappear when human beings began to build cities and nations. It surfaces even today in sophisticated, wealthy societies that have no doubts about their survival.<br>&nbsp;<br>But as human beings became more secure, achieved greater control over their environment, and began to build towns and cities, some had the leisure to explore the interior life and find ways of controlling their destructive impulses. From about 900 to 200 BCE, during what the German philosopher Karl Jaspers called the &#x201c;Axial Age,&#x201d; there occurred a religious revolution that proved pivotal to the spiritual development of humanity. In four distinct regions, sages, prophets, and mystics began to develop traditions that have continued to nourish men and women: Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism on the Indian subcontinent; Confucianism and Daoism in China; monotheism in the Middle East; and philosophical rationalism in Greece.5 This was the period of the Upanishads, the Buddha, Confucius, Laozi, Isaiah, Ezekiel, Ezra, Socrates, and Aeschylus. We have never surpassed the insights of the Axial Age. In times of spiritual and social crisis, people have repeatedly turned back to it for guidance. They may have interpreted the Axial discoveries differently, but they never succeeded in going beyond them. Rabbinic Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, for example, were all latter-day flowerings of this original vision, which they translated marvelously into an idiom that spoke directly to the troubled circumstances of a later period. Compassion would be a key element in each of these movements.<br>&nbsp;<br>The Aryan peoples of India would always be in the vanguard of this spiritual and psychological transformation and would develop a particularly sophisticated understanding of the workings of the mind. Aggressive, passionate warriors addicted to raiding and rustling the cattle of neighboring groups, the Aryan tribes, who had settled in what is now the Punjab, had sacralized their violence. Their religious rituals included the sacrificial slaughter of animals, fierce competitions, and mock raids and battles in which participants were often injured or even killed. But in the ninth century BCE, priests began systematically to extract this aggression from the liturgy, transforming these dangerous rites into more anodyne ceremonies. Eventually they managed to persuade the warriors to give up their sacred war games. As these ritual specialists began to investigate the causes of violence in the psyche, they initiated a spiritual awakening.6 From a very early date, therefore, they had espoused the ideal of <i>ahimsa </i>(&#x201c;nonviolence&#x201d;) that would become central to Indian spirituality.<br>&nbsp;<br>In the seventh century BCE, the sages who produced the earliest of the spiritual treatises known as the Upanishads took another important step forward. Instead of concentrating on the performance of external rites, they began to examine their interior significance. At this time Aryan society in the Ganges basin was in the early stages of urbanization.7 The elite now had time to examine the inner workings of their minds&#x2014;a luxury that had not been possible before humans were freed from the all-absorbing struggle for subsistence. The Brhadaranyaka Upanishad was probably composed in the kingdom of Videha, a frontier state on the most easterly point of Aryan expansion, where Aryans mixed with tribesmen from Iran as well as the indigenous peoples.8 The early Upanishads reflect the intense excitement of these encounters. People thought nothing of traveling a thousand miles to consult a teacher, and kings and warriors debated the issues as eagerly as priests.<br>&nbsp;<br>The sages and their pupils explored the complexity of the mind and had discovered the unconscious long before Jung and Freud; they were well aware of the effortless and reflexive drives of the human brain recently explored by neuroscientists. Above all, they were bent on finding the atman, the true &#x201c;self&#x201d; that was the source of all this mental activity and could not, therefore, be identical with the thoughts and feelings that characterize our ordinary mental and psychological experience. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t see the Seer, who does the seeing,&#x201d; explained Yajnavalkya, one of the most important of the early sages. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t hear the Hearer who does the hearing; you can&#x2019;t think with the Thinker who does the thinking; and you can&#x2019;t perceive the Perceiver who does the perceiving.&#x201d;9 The sages were convinced that if they could access the innermost core of their being, they would achieve unity with the Brahman, &#x201c;the All,&#x201d; the indestructible and imperishable energy that fuels the cosmos, establishes its laws, and pulls all the disparate parts of the universe together.10<br>&nbsp;<br>The sages and their pupils claimed that their mental exercises, disciplined lifestyle, and intensely dialectical discussions had uncovered the atman and introduced them to a more potent mode of being. The way they described this experience suggests that it may have originated in the brain&#x2019;s soothing system, which takes over when an animal is at rest and free of threat. A person who knows the atman, said Yajnavalkya, is &#x201c;calm, composed, cool, patient and collected.&#x201d; Above all, he is &#x201c;free from fear,&#x201d; a phrase that runs like a thread through these texts.11 But the peace discovered by the sages was more than bovine relaxation. They distinguished carefully and consistently between this new knowledge and a temporary, contingent contentment that is repeatedly overwhelmed by the Four Fs. The peaceful mood of a calf resting quietly beside his mother cannot ...</p><h2>Franz Marc and August Macke: 1909-1914</h2><p><b>This generously illustrated volume focuses on the poignant friendship of Franz Marc and August Macke, two innovative members of the Blue Rider group.</b><br><br>During the five years Franz Marc and August Macke knew each other, the two men carried on an artistic and personal friendship that had an immense impact of each of their careers.

In the post-Christian world, doubt and skepticism come naturally to us. Many have given up on faith of any kind, finding it shallow and unsatisfying. But still we yearn for more. We hope for our children's futures. We long for lives that are meaningful, even eternal. Grappling with his own questions, Jim Belcher set out on a quest to see how the Christian faith faces the challenges of the modern world and answers the cries of the human soul. Seeking renewal after a draining season of life, he and his family spent a year traveling through Europe, exploring the faith that has shaped civilizations throughout the centuries. They rediscovered key figures, places and events in the history of Christianity, from C. S. Lewis's life at Oxford to Dietrich Bonhoeffer's death in a concentration camp. Through the experiences of William Wilberforce, Vincent Van Gogh, Corrie ten Boom and others, Belcher saw glimpses of insight, beauty and courage that transcended human limitations. He found himself surprised by joy and compelled by faith. Whether you are giving up on Christianity or encountering it for the first time, you are invited to come along on this pilgrimage. Even if you are unsure of the destination, the journey itself may take you far deeper than you could ever imagine. FROM THE AUTHOR The story of In Search of Deep Faith by Jim Belcher After almost 20 years pastoring two congregations, raising four children and finishing my first book, I was tired and worn down?out of gas. I needed to make a change, to find a way to regain my passion for my calling. While I was exhausted, my wife and I were also worried about our four children and whether they were developing a strong enough faith to last a lifetime. Were they being more influenced by the culture around them?the media, materialism and friends?than by the story of Christianity and its reality in their lives? Then we hit on an idea. What if we traveled on a pilgrimage for a year to England and Europe, and studied and experienced the biographies and places of some of the great heroes of the faith?people like C.S Lewis, Sheldon Vanauken, William Wilberforce, Corrie ten Boom, Dietrich Bonhoeffer and Maria Von Trapp. Maybe this could get my passion back for my calling and at the same time help my children develop a deeper faith?a faith that shaped their imaginations and identities and futures. So we left the comforts of Orange County, Ca and moved to Oxford, England. We didn?t have any definite plans but upon arriving we discovered that a pilgrimage has three components: to rediscover our roots, to understand that life is a journey and to know our ultimate destination. These three ideas became our inspiration, shaping the themes we pursued, revealing the heroes we studied, and steering us across time and place. And as the pilgrimage unfolded, day by day, month by month, what we learned and experienced over the year would startle us and surprise us and change us forever. In Search of Deep Faith is the record of this pilgrimage, an unfolding drama marked by suspense and intrigue. I hope you will take the journey with us and go deeper into the faith than you could ever imagine.</p><p>Jim Belcher (Ph.D., Georgetown; M.A., Fuller) is associate professor of practical theology at Knox Theological Seminary in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

Now for the first time, he tells us in his own words the fascinating story of his life in this witty, candid, and revealing memoir. <br><br> For more than fifty years, Ernest--or "Ernie" as he's known to his friends--has been one of the most recognized, celebrated stars in Hollywood as well as a respected, talented actor, and a living legend. Stretching from his childhood as the son of Italian immigrants to a spectacular career that is still thriving in his 91st year, from the early days of live TV to the voiceovers for <i>The Simpsons </i> and <i>SpongeBob SquarePants,</i> Ernie tells of the trials and tribulations on his road to fame, the friendships he shared with some of the silver screen's biggest stars, and the glamorous leading ladies he loved. <br><br> Acclaimed for his ability to play sensitive and tough-guy roles equally well, he was also famous for squaring off against some of Hollywood's most formidable actresses--including Bette Davis in <i>A Catered Affair </i> and Joan Crawford in <i>Johnny Guitar.</i> Recalling his experiences starring in classic movies such as <i>The Poseidon Adventure, The Wild Bunch,</i> and <i>Escape from New York,</i> he reveals personal insights and irresistible stories about cinema's greatest icons--including Spencer Tracy, James Stewart, Kirk Douglas, Montgomery Clift, Gary Cooper, Janet Leigh, Raquel Welch, Gene Hackman, Rock Hudson, Sammy Davis, Jr., Tony Curtis, Alan Ladd, Glenn Ford, and Burt Lancaster. And with characteristic frankness, he also talks about his off-screen loves and passions. <br><br>A must for every film buff, <i>Ernie: An Autobiography</i> is a fascinating memoir--filled with secrets, well-remembered details, and never-before-told stories--of a star who has thrived in the changing world of Hollywood for more than half a century, and endeared himself to legions of fans everywhere. <br><br> "(Borgnine's) anecdotes are gleefully self-deprecating. . .he comes off as the kind of guy you'd like to have a beer with." --<i>NY Post </i><br><br> "With astute observations on the Hollywood hierarchy and tales about everyone from Lee Marvin and Steve McQueen to Bette Davis and Kim Novak, (Borgnine) writes with an unassuming, no-nonsense tone.

He lives in Los Angeles with his wife, Tova.Oscar-winner Borgnine reflects on a career spanning six decades and totaling more than 190 film and television roles. After a nomadic childhood (Connecticut to Chicago to Italy), Borgnine, born in 1917, returned to Connecticut for high school. Following 10 years in the navy, he studied drama at Hartford's Randall School and began acting at Virginia's Barter Theater, advancing to live TV and Broadway roles. His striking performance as the sadistic Fatso in <i>From Here to Eternity</i> (1953) catapulted his career, and two years later he won an Academy Award for his portrayal of the lonely Bronx butcher in Paddy Chayefsky's <i>Marty</i>. In the 1960s, he was reluctant to do a TV series until an encounter with a teen who recognized Borgnine but couldn't name any of his films prompted the actor to immediately do the TV series <i>McHale's Navy</i>. Summoning up on-set movie memories, Borgnine unleashes an arsenal of anecdotes, such as Joan Crawford's hatred of Mercedes McCambridge: Joan thought she was mocking her... and she let fly a fusillade of insults like I've never heard, not even in the Navy. With astute observations on the Hollywood hierarchy and tales about everyone from Lee Marvin and Steve McQueen to Bette Davis and Kim Novak, he writes with an unassuming, no-nonsense tone. His love of filmmaking and his respect for his fellow actors permeates the pages of this engaging and satisfying memoir. <i>(Aug.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

David Remnick is fascinated by the men and women obsessed with creating the history of our era as well as those intent on chronicling it. Public figures rarely step away from their public selves. But Remnick has the ability to see the private self beneath the public fa�ade and give readers startling glimpses of familiar figures: Al Gore attacking George Bush as he tries to make sense of his incomprehensible loss in the 2000 election, Tony Blair struggling for votes in the midst of the Iraq crisis.<br><br>In <i>Reporting,</i> Remnick returns to two countries he knows well, Russia and Israel. His account of Vladimir Putin contending with Gorbachev&#x2019;s legacy affords a fresh view of postcommunist Russia; his appraisals of Benjamin Netanyahu, Ariel Sharon, and Sari Nusseibeh of the P.L.O. shed unexpected light on the Israeli-Palestinian crisis. Often, Remnick&#x2019;s intent is to see someone up close, if only for a moment in time: Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn as he packs his bags to return to Russia, V�clav Havel as he prepares to end his career as President of the Czech Republic.<br><br>Whether David Remnick is writing about Katharine Graham and the state of American newspapers, the literary visions of Philip Roth and Don DeLillo, or the decline and fall of Mike Tyson and the sport of boxing, his powers of observation, analysis, compassion, and wit are always present. <i>Reporting</i> is confirmation of Remnick&#x2019;s skill at writing insightful and influential political and cultural narratives, and of his unique gift for bringing his subjects to life on the page with extraordinary clarity and depth.</p><p>David Remnick was a reporter for <i>The Washington Post</i> from 1982 to 1991 and joined the staff of <i>The New Yorker</i> in 1992. He has been the editor of the magazine since 1998.The Wilderness Campaign:<br><br> Al Gore<br><br> Hey, Dwayne? . . . Dwayne?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yes, Mr. Vice-President?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Could I have some more coffee?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yes, Mr. Vice-President. Coming . . .&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Thanks, Dwayne.&#x201d;<br><br> It was ten in the morning in Nashville, a quiet weekday, with most of the neighbors off to work, and Albert Gore, Jr., sat at the head of his dining-room table eating breakfast. His plate was crowded with scrambled eggs, bacon, toast. His pond-size mug had, in a flash, been refilled by Dwayne Kemp, his cook, a skilled and graceful man who had been employed by the Gores when, as his boss often puts it, &#x201c;we were still working in the White House.&#x201d; Freshly showered and shaved, Gore was wearing a midnight-blue shirt and gray wool trousers. In the months after losing the battle for Florida&#x2019;s electoral votes and conceding the Presidency to George W. Bush, on December 13, 2000, Gore seemed to let himself go, dropping out of sight, traveling around Spain, Italy, and Greece for six weeks with his wife, Tipper. He wore dark glasses and a baseball cap tugged down low. He grew a mountain-man beard and gained weight. When he began appearing in public again, mainly in classrooms, he took to introducing himself by saying, &#x201c;Hi, I&#x2019;m Al Gore. I used to be the next President of the United States.&#x201d; People looked at this rather bulky and hirsute man&#x2014;a politician who had only recently won 50,999,897 votes for the Presidency, more than any Democrat in history, more than any candidate in history except Ronald Reagan in 1984, and more than half a million more votes than the man who assumed the office&#x2014;and did not know quite what to feel or how to behave, and so they cooperated in his elaborate self-deprecations. They laughed at his jokes, as if to help him erase what everyone understood to be a disappointment of historic proportions&#x2014;&#x201c;the heartbreak of a lifetime,&#x201d; as Karenna, the eldest of his four children, put it. &#x201c;You know the old saying,&#x201d; Gore told one audience after another. &#x201c;You win some, you lose some&#x2014;and then there&#x2019;s that little-known third category.&#x201d;<br><br> Gore has since dispensed with the beard but not the weight. He is still thick around the middle. He eats quickly and thoroughly, and with a determined relish, precisely like a man who no longer has to care that he might look heavy on Larry King Live. &#x201c;You want some eggs?&#x201d; he asked. &#x201c;Dwayne&#x2019;s the best.&#x201d;<br><br> This has been the first election season in a generation in which Al Gore has not pursued national office. He ran for President in 1988, when he was thirty-nine; for Vice-President, on Bill Clinton&#x2019;s ticket, in 1992 and 1996; and then again for President in 2000. Having decided that a rematch against Bush would be too divisive (or, perhaps, too difficult), Gore has made an effort not to brood on the sidelines. Instead, he used words like &#x201c;liberated&#x201d; and &#x201c;free&#x201d; with a determined conviction to describe his inner condition. He was free of the burden, free of the pressure, free of the camera&#x2019;s eye. At home in Nashville, the phone barely rang. There were no advance people at the door, no aides at his shoulder. He could say what he wanted and it hardly made a ripple in the media. If he felt like calling George Bush a &#x201c;moral coward,&#x201d; if he felt like comparing Guant�namo and Abu Ghraib to islands in an &#x201c;American gulag&#x201d; or the President&#x2019;s media operatives to &#x201c;digital Brown Shirts,&#x201d; well, he just went ahead and did it. No worries, no hesitation. True, at noon at the Belcourt Theatre, he was to deliver a speech to a group called the Music Row Democrats, but the only cameras were likely to be local. He jokingly outlined the speech on a small notepad with just two words: &#x201c;war&#x201d; and &#x201c;economy.&#x201d;<br><br> When Al and Tipper Gore had recovered from the initial shock of the 2000 election, they spent $2.3 million on the house they live in now: a hundred-year-old colonial on Lynwood Boulevard, in the Belle Meade section of Nashville. They still own a place in Arlington, Virginia&#x2014;a house that was built by Tipper&#x2019;s grandfather&#x2014;and a ninety-acre cattle farm in the Gore family seat of Carthage, Tennessee; but Arlington was perilously close to Washington, and Carthage was too remote for a full-time residence, especially for Tipper. Belle Meade, which resembles Buckhead, in Atlanta, or Mountain Brook, near Birmingham, is a prosperous redoubt for businessmen and country-music stars; it encompasses a neighborhood of broad, sloping lawns, and houses with magnolia trees and &#x201c;estate&#x201d; driveways up front and glassy modern additions and swimming pools out back. Chet Atkins used to be a neighbor; Leon Russell still is. Some of the features of the house, which the couple expanded with the help of an architect, are distinctly Gore-ish: Tipper&#x2019;s full drum set, in the living room (complete with congas); Al&#x2019;s grip-and-grin photographs with the Clintons and world leaders, along the walls. There are fewer books and more televisions than you might expect. When the architect was designing the rear addition to the house, Gore asked him to curve the walls inward in two places in order to save several trees. &#x201c;The trees weren&#x2019;t anything special, nothing rare or anything,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I just couldn&#x2019;t bear to bring &#x2019;em down.&#x201d; In the backyard, around the patio and the extra-long pool, where Al and Tipper do laps, Gore also installed an anti-bug system that sprays a fine mist of ground chrysanthemums from various discreet sources: a tree trunk, a patio wall. &#x201c;The mosquitoes just hate it,&#x201d; he said. Other features of the house are less environmentally correct. A 2004 black Cadillac, which Gore drives, was parked in the driveway. A &#x2019;65 Mustang&#x2014;a Valentine&#x2019;s Day gift from Al to Tipper&#x2014;was parked in the garage.<br><br> Gore finished his eggs. He walked to a covered patio on the side of the house and settled into a soft chair. Dwayne brought his coffee cup and refilled it.<br><br> Gore has hardly been a recluse since deciding, in late 2002, not to run again. In the past year, he has delivered a series of speeches in New York and Washington sharply criticizing the Bush Administration, but he has answered few questions. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s better that way for a while,&#x201d; he said. He has given speeches for money all around the world. And he is teaching courses, mainly about the intersection of community and the American family, at Middle Tennessee State University, in Murfreesboro, and Fisk University, in Nashville.<br><br> &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got about forty hours of lectures and classes on tape,&#x201d; Gore said, deadpan. &#x201c;Now&#x2019;s your chance to watch them.&#x201d;<br><br> Gore is beginning to make serious money. He is a board member for Apple and a senior adviser to Google, which just went through its IPO. He has also been working on creating a cable-television station and developing a financial enterprise.<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m having a blast,&#x201d; he said.<br><br> In a parliamentary system, a candidate for Prime Minister, after losing an election, often returns to the party leadership or at least to a prominent seat in parliament. It doesn&#x2019;t work that way in the United States. Here, you make your own way: you give speeches, write memoirs, accumulate a fortune, find a righteous cause. Sometimes a reporter might come calling, but not often. In any case, Donna Brazile, Gore&#x2019;s campaign manager in 2000, said, &#x201c;When it was over, the Democratic Party kicked him to the curb,&#x201d; preferring to forget not only the Florida catastrophe but also Gore&#x2019;s own misplays: his mutating personality in the three debates with Bush; his reliance on political consultants; his inability to exploit Bill Clinton&#x2019;s enduring popularity and his failure to win Clinton&#x2019;s Arkansas, much less Tennessee; his decision not to press immediately for a statewide recount in Florida. Now, everywhere he goes, Gore is faced with crowds who despair of the Bush Administration and see in him all that might have been, all the what-ifs. The heartbreak of a lifetime. Sometimes people approach him and address him as &#x201c;Mr. President.&#x201d; Some try to cheer him up and tell him, &#x201c;We know you really won.&#x201d; Some tilt their heads, affecting a look of grave sympathy, as if he had just lost a family member. He has to face not only his own regrets; he is forever the mirror of others&#x2019;. A lesser man would have done far worse than grow a beard and put on a few pounds.<br><br> Consider the expectations: more than Franklin Roosevelt, or even John F. Kennedy, Gore was raised to be President. His father, Albert Gore, Sr., a senator who was known to look as noble as a Roman statesman, expected it of him. When Gore&#x2019;s mother was pregnant with Al, Gore Senior told the editors of the Nashville Tennessean that if his wife gave birth to a boy he didn&#x2019;t want to see the story tucked deep in the paper. After Al was born, the headline read, well, mr. gore, here he is, on page 1. Six years later, the Senator planted a story in the Knoxville News Sentinel about how young Al had coaxed his father into buying him a more expensive bow-and-arrow set than they had planned to get. &#x201c;There may be another Gore on the way toward the political pinnacle,&#x201d; the story said. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s just six years old now. But with his experiences to date, who knows what may happen.&#x201d; By the time Gore made it to Harvard (the only school he applied to), he was informing his class of his ultimate ambition. His first run, in 1988, after he had spent just a few years in the Senate, was less an act of youthful presumption than a hurried attempt to win t...</p><h2>Indian Food Made Easy</h2><p>Very good.

Beginning with Egyptian Pharaoh Ramses III's victory over the piractical Sea Peoples in 1190 BC, and coming up-to-date with the use of aircraft carriers and the latest computerized weapons technology, the book covers every significant development in naval warfare over the last 3000 years.</p><p>The first chapter covers some of the major naval engagements of the ancient era, including the Greeks' emphatic victory over the Persians at Salamis (480 BC) and Octavian's decisive defeat of Mark Anthony at Actium (31 BC). The use of galleys as the premier fighting ship for more than 2000 years is explored in detail. The second chapter investigates the development of new types of fighting vessels, such as the northern European cog, at battles such as Sluys (1340 AD), which also offering expert analysis of the introduction of cannon at Hansando (1592) and the spectacular use of fireships against the Spanish Armada at Gravelines (1588). The third chapter examines the age of sail, from the early seventeenth century to the late eighteenth century, through famous encounters at the Downs (1639), Medway (1667), and Quiberon Bay (1759). The chapter rounds off with the Russo-Swedish battled of Svensksund (1790), demonstrating one of the last uses of galleys in European naval warfare. The fourth chapter surveys the transformation from the employment of the last great fighting sailing ships at battles such as Copenhagen (1801) and Trafalgar (1805) to the advent of steam-powered ironclads at Mobile Bay (1864). The final chapter covers the development and use of armored battleships at Tsushima (1905) and Jutland (1916), and the revolutionary introduction of aircraft carriers at Cape Matapan (1941) and Midway (1942).</p><p>Using specially-commissioned color maps and black-and-white artworks, <i>Fighting Techniques of Naval Warfare</i> is an essential companion for anyone interested in naval warfare.</p></p><p><p><b>Iain Dickie</b>'s interest in military matters was first inspired by pictures of Roman artillery at the age of 12. based in Britain, he has been a committee member of the Society of Ancients, the editor of <i>Army &amp; Navy Modelworld </i>, <i>Military Hobbies</i>, and <i>Miniature Wargames</i> magazines.</p><p><b>Martin J.

Until steam power became widely available, waterways -- salt and fresh -were the preferred means of transportation for armies, supplies and building materials. Thus, after the fall of the Romans, a vacuum in naval power allowed the Vikings to land armies where wanted. Not only did they make the sea their motorway, they also sailed far inland along rivers, even besieging Paris in 885 AD.</b>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><b>D</b>uring the late twelfth century BC, Egypt was beset by foreign invaders. The cities and fertile territories subject to the pharaoh Ramses III were eyed enviously by all around him. He only had to turn his attention to one corner of his empire for his enemies to make inroads into another.To the south were the Nubian Kushites, probably the enemy most familiar to the Egyptians since there was some level of trade between the peoples. The waters of the Nile, which brought shipping and fertilized Egypt's fields, formed a highway from these southern lands into the heart of the Egyptian kingdom. South of the second cataract (one of the shallow stretches of rocky, turbulent rapids), the Nile also fertilized the lands of the Nubians, allowing their wealth to grow and become a serious rival to Egyptian power. Ramses had 15 sophisticated fortresses, each garrisoned by up to 300 regular troops, in the region of the second cataract, plus a naval base at the first cataract to defend against the Nubians from Ethiopia. For the moment, these defences were sufficient; a few centuries later, however, the Kushites would break through to conquer Egypt.To the west of Egypt, the Libyans, with their seemingly alien customs, lurked menacingly. Periodically they migrated in huge armies made of several different tribes, searching for fertile land to settle.They had little in the way of horses or metal, however, and at the battle of Hatsho in the fifth year of his reign, Ramses was easily able to defeat the Libyans. Lines of archers backed by spearmen advanced directly towards the tribesmen while chariots and javelin men harassed their flanks. When the Libyans broke, they were pursued for over 80km (50 miles), a victory attributed to superior Egyptian technology and organization.In the north of his kingdom, to the west of the Nile Delta, Ramses built a fortified zone to protect against invasion by the Libyans and the mysterious Sea Peoples. It was here that his predecessor, Merneptah, had defeated a Libyan and Sea Peoples alliance just 50 years earlier. This zone would give early warning of an incursion from the Mediterranean by the Sea Peoples or along the coastal route from the west by the Libyans. To the east of Egypt, there were civilized peoples, the Hittites, with whom messages and ambassadors could be exchanged. However, the Hittites were weak and unable to hold back their own enemies, including the Sea Peoples.<b>Ramses III and the Sea Peoples: Battle on the Nile</b>The identity of these invaders, referred to in Egyptian inscriptions as the 'foreign peoples of the sea', is still something of a mystery. It seems likely that the Sea Peoples originated from Greece and islands in the Mediterranean. They are depicted by the Egyptians as two distinct groups. One group, known to the Egyptians as the Sherden, wear horned helmets very similar to those worn by the Acheans who fought at Troy. Indeed, although dates are difficult to establish, one theory places the end of the siege of Troy close to the beginning of the reign of Ramses III. The second group are shown sporting headdresses made of vertical stalks, possibly feathers.These are the Peleset, better known as the Philistines, who gave their name to Palestine. During the twelfth century BC, the Peleset swept aside the once-great Hittite Empire in a huge migration of men, women, children and flocks.<b>Egyptian Marine (1200 BC)</b><i>Armed with a javelin that had a range of about 30m (98ft), and a mace or club, the marine also carried a shield. He may have discarded this when the sea was rough, preferring to hold onto the boat.. The tunic was made from small pieces of metal or leather, known as scales. These were sewn onto a linen backing and overlapped each other, covering the stitches and affording some degree of protection against light missiles. The kilt was a design copied from earlier contact with the Sea Peoples. Note the bare feet, which gave better grip on the wooden deck than leather sandles.</i>It is possible that the Sherden and Peleset joined together in the southern part of the collapsing Hittite Empire. While the main body approached Egypt across the Sinai desert, the ships of the Sea Peoples moved ahead and entered the Nile Delta. Such a movement could be neither rapid nor secret, so Ramses III had plenty of time to assess his enemy's strength and to prepare a response.At his disposal, Ramses had two armies in the eastern delta, facing the Libyans. Another army was held in reserve in the centre of the kingdom, possibly at Thebes, and one was in the south facing the Nubians. The soldiers were conscripted, one man in 10 being liable for service.The Egyptian population was organized into generations of roughly 100,000. By this means, it has been calculated that 10,000 fresh recruits were available each year. We do not know the length of service, but we do have details of a force of 8362, including noncombatants, sent on an expedition to the south in the reign of Ramses IV. If this was a portion of the army of the south and we assume a prudent two-thirds of that army were left behind, that would make an army of about 25,000 men and a term of service of 10 years. The infantry were organizedinto units of 250, the charioteers into units of 50. Military police accompanied the force.Although Ramses maintained a fleet of ships, these were considered to be a part of the army. In addition, tribesmen from the fringes of the empire were recruited as auxiliary troops. We can assume he also used some of these tribesmen as scouts and spies, since they could more easily blend with the advancing horde and discover the final destination of the enemy's fleet. How else could Ramses have known to position his ships in the delta when there were so many possible landing sites on the Egyptian coast? For the coming campaign, Ramses summoned his land forces to Pi-Ramses, about 8km (5 miles) north of Suez, and commandeered all sorts of craft from the Nile and coastal areas.His warships were equipped with 10 oars per side, a single mast with crow's nest, castles fore and aft, and a single steering oar. At the prow was a ram shaped like a lion's head and sheathed in metal, probably bronze.A slinger was posted in the crow's nest, a man with a grappling hook on the forecastle, and a boarding pike was wielded from the bow. For the rest of the fighting crew, a part of the army was selected and trained as marines, and armed with bows or javelins. The marines wore knee-length, linen kilts, possibly reinforced with leather strips.Above the waist they wore armour in the form of overlapping bronze scales sewn onto a cloth backing. An armoured helmet was made in the same way. The oarsmen were also expected to fight.The total crew numbered just 50 men.The hulls of the Egyptian ships had a distinct belly in the centre and were relatively narrow, perhaps 16m (50ft) long and just 2m (7ft) wide. This made them a fairly good shape for rowing. They had sides high enough to protect all but the heads of the oarsmen. On the Medinet Habu monument and Queen Nefertiti's barge, the bows and sterns of the boats are shown extending fore and aft in a graceful arc above the waterline. Their leaf-shaped oars appear through the hull sides and the rowers face the stern. The planks of the hulls were lashed together with fibrous rope. We can also assume that the hulls were built from dry wood; when this became wet, it would expand and seal the gaps between the planks, keeping the lashings taut.The ships of the Sea Peoples are depicted on Egyptian monuments with a similar hull shape to the Egyptian vessels: with castles and crow's nests but without rams or oars. They may have had paddles, although these are not shown. The stem and sternposts seem to be decorated with duck's head shapes. Their crews appear to have used the javelin but not the bow. They also wore knee-length kilts, of a type also worn by the Egyptians. Above the waist, their armour is shown as made of either leather, muscled corselets or strips of overlapping leather, similar to that worn by the Egyptians.<b>Clash in the Nile Delta</b>While the Sea Peoples approached the Nile Delta in their ships, their families and goods travelled on slow-moving ox-drawn carts, presumably with a military escort. These convoys were attacked by the Egyptian chariots, auxiliaries and skirmishers and destroyed, those who were not killed becoming slaves. The attacking force, a small proportion of the whole Egyptian army, is another indication that Ramses had good intelligence of his enemy's plans and movements.Meanwhile, the naval assault sailed into the mouth of the Nile, presumably on a northerlywind. Once inside the reed-bound, meandering channels of the Nile Delta, they were trapped. It was difficult to find the right channel without a local pilot and the papyrus sedge formed great clumps 4-5m (13-16ft) high, making it hard to see the masts of lurking ships.As the wind slackened - which it always does moving from the sea inshore - they would have found it hard to manoeuvre.As the southerly flow of the Nile competed with the northerly wind, the Egyptian ships appeared behind and in front of the Sea Peoples' fleet.The Egyptians fired a shower of arrows from a range of 150m (500ft) and javelins from 15m (50ft) as their ships cl...</p><h2>100 Trails of the Big South Fork: Tennessee &amp; Kentucky</h2><p><br><br>* 100 hikes, their maps, and driving directions to the trail heads<br><br>* Includes Big South Fork park history, natural history, geology, and safety information<br>The Big South Fork has a well-deserved reputation as one of the most beautiful recreation areas in the U.S., with a trail system that lets you hike from Tennessee to Kentuck and back.

And if the job is done right, the fool doesn&#39;t even realize it&#39;s happened until the wily con artist has moved on to the next victim or the next town. In this entertaining and eye-opening book, Dennis M. Marlock, a retired cop and chairman of the board for the international law enforcement organization Professionals Against Confidence Crime, takes the reader into the mind and greedy heart of the con man. You&#39;ll learn the mechanics behind famous swindles such as the pigeon drop, the Jamaican switch, bank-examiner schemes, three-card monte and even fortune-telling. You&#39;ll find out why a good scam artist rarely gets caught and, if he does, how he gets away with the lightest punishment or no punishment at all. If you&#39;ve ever read a news story about a sucker getting taken and wondered how he could have fallen for that, you need to read this book before an honest-faced stranger offers you a deal too good to pass up.</p><p>Dennis M. Marlock recently retired from the Milwaukee Police Department, where he spent most of his 31-year career investigating frauds and confidence crimes.

There was even more publicity when the ship made a dramatic escape after being trapped for 101 days. Eulogized by the British as an example of outstanding courage and fortitude, the 'Yangtze Incident' was even made into a feature film, which depicted the ship and her crew as innocent victims of Communist aggression.<br><p>The truth was more complex, and so sensitive that the government intended that the files should be closed until 2030. However, these have now been released and in making use of these documents this book is the first to tell the full story. What emerges is an intriguing tale of intelligence failure, military over-confidence and a hero with feet of clay - it is by no means as heroic as the well-publicized official version, but every bit as entertaining. While the reputations of diplomatic and naval top brass take a knock, the bravery and ingenuity of those actively involved shines even more brightly. Written with verve and including much new and surprising information, this book is both enjoyable and informative.</p></p><p>Brian Izzard was a Fleet Street journalist, feature writer and news subeditor for many years, working latterly on the <i>Daily Express</i> and the <i>Sunday Express</i>.

They ask searching questions about what may happen to children denied exposure to wild places - a reality for more children today than at any time in human history. The authors remember pivotal events in their own childhood that led each to a life-long relationship with the land: Nabhan&#39;s wanderings in the wasteland of steel mills and power plants of Gary, Indiana, and in the Indiana Dunes; Trimble&#39;s travels in the West with a geologist father. They tell stories of children learning about wild places and creatures in settings ranging from cities and suburbs to isolated Nevada sheep ranches to Native American communities in the Southwest and Mexico. The Geography of Childhood draws insights from fields as various as evolutionary biology, child psychology, education, and ethnography. The book urges adults to rethink our children&#39;s contact with nature. Small children have less need for large-scale wilderness than for a garden, gully, or field to create a crucial tie to the natural world. Nabhan suggests that traditional wilderness-oriented rites of passage may help cure the alienation of adolescence: &#34;Those who as adolescents fail to pass through such rites remain in an arrested state of immaturity for the remainder of their lives&#34;. Trimble&#39;s fatherhood leads him to question how we grant different freedoms to girls and boys in their exploration of nature - and how this bias powerfully affects adult lives. Both authors return to their experiences with indigenous peoples to show how nature is taught and wilderness understood in cultures historicallygrounded outside of America&#39;s cities and suburbs. The Geography of Childhood makes clear how human growth remains rooted, as it always has, both in childhood and in wild landscapes. It is an essential book for all parents and teachers who wonder what our children may miss if they never experience local wildlife or wild landscapes.Gary Paul Nabhan, a MacArthur Fellow and plant conservationist, is author of <i>Songbirds, Truffles, and Wolves: An American Naturalist in Italy,</i> among other books.

It's just too creepy to get inside a killer's twisted mind. But he comes back to stop a madman who's been butchering entire families. The FBI needs Graham's insight, and Graham needs Lecter's genius. But Lecter is a clever fiend, and he manipulates both Graham and the killer at large from his cell.</p><p> That killer, Francis Dolarhyde, works in a film lab, where he picks his victims by studying their home movies. He's obsessed with William Blake's bizarre painting <i>The Great Red Dragon and the Woman Clothed with the Sun</i>, believing there's a red dragon within him, the personification of his demonic drives. Flashbacks to Dolarhyde's terrifying childhood and superb stream-of-consciousness prose get us right there inside his head. When Dolarhyde does weird things, we understand why. We <i>sympathize</i> when the voice of the cruel dead grandma who raised and crazed him urges him to mayhem--she's way scarier than that old bat in <i>Psycho</i>. When he falls in love with a blind girl at the lab, we hope he doesn't give in to Grandma's violent advice.</p><p> This book is awesomely detailed, ingeniously plotted, judiciously gory, and fantastically imagined.

Over the course of approximately a year, she became completely blind, as a result of a retinal hemorrhage. This is her own account of her journey from sight to blindness and the courageous and successful efforts she made to create a new life for herself. Alexander's moving and eloquent story is skillfully read by Suzanne Toren, whose voice is soft and understated. Her considerable experience presents the listener with a natural sounding reading, as though one were listening to the author herself. M.T.F. � AudioFile 2002, Portland, Maine-- <i>Copyright � AudioFile, Portland, Maine</i>Gr. 6-12. Alexander's story of her adjustment to blindness reads like a gripping suspense novel. She was a perfectly healthy third-grade teacher when she first noticed a black line flit across her eye and disappear. After a series of doctor appointments, temporary vision losses, and hospital stays, she gradually realized that at some point she would be completely blind. She began to learn Braille and eventually checked into a center to learn new life skills. Her emphasis is not on the hospitals and the rehab center but on coming to grips with her disability and all the accompanying emotions of fear, anger, despair, and acceptance. Her rocky relationship with her boyfriend is realistically and poignantly portrayed. Since the ending downplays the serious obstacles she has yet to face, the story is uplifting, and readers will find the pages turning quickly. Although intended for a much younger audience, Alexander's <i>Mom Can't See Me</i> (1990), in which life with a blind mother is described by her nine-year-old daughter and shown in photos by George Ancona, may interest readers of this autobiographical account. <i>Susan DeRonne</i></p><h2>Sea Dragons: Predators of the Prehistoric Oceans</h2><p>Working from the fossil record, Richard Ellis explores the natural history of these fierce predators, speculates on their habits, and tells how they eventually became extinct - or did they? He traces the 200-million-year history of the great ichthyosaurs, plesiosaurs, and mosasaurs who swam the ancient oceans - and who, according to some, may even still frequent the likes of Loch Ness.<br>The first book about these animals in nearly a century, Sea Dragons draws upon the most recent scientific research to reconstruct their lives and habitats. Along the way, the book also provides insights into and tales about the work, discoveries, and competing theories that compose the world of vertebrate paleontology.</p><p>"Ellis has written the paleohistorical equivalent of <i>Jaws</i>. Modern-day sharks are anchovies compared to the monstrous great reptiles of prehistoric seas, most of which were bigger, faster, more powerful, omnivorous, and better armed."--Peter Benchley, author of <i>Jaws</i> and <i>Shark Trouble</i> <p>"With this book, Richard Ellis complements his previously published works on living marine creatures with a riveting account of those long-necked, sharp-toothed, and in some cases, armor-plated giants of the 100-million-year-old seas. His exploration of the past brilliantly showcases creatures more astonishing than any Loch Ness Monster we can dream up."--Michael Novacek, Provost of Science and Curator of Paleontology, American Museum of Natural History and author of <i>Time Traveler: In Search of Dinosaurs and Other Fossils from Montana to Mongolia</i> </p><p>"Dinosaurs were the most magnificent creatures that ever walked the earth and remain a subject of enduring fascination, as witnessed by the highly popular <i>Jurassic Park</i>. Ellis's vivid and delightfully illustrated book chronicles a lesser-known but equally magnificent group of these extraordinary mega fauna-the remarkable giants that swam the great Mesozoic seas."--Sir Arthur C. Clarke, author of <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i> </p><p>"This is really the first book to present a detailed summary of the history of ideas on marine reptile paleontology. It's also very readable and accessible, which is one of Ellis's trademarks as a writer."--Michael Caldwell, curator of higher vertebrates at the University of Alberta Museum of Paleontology and associate editor of <i>Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology</i></p>Richard Ellis is a research associate in vertebrate paleontology at the American Museum of Natural History.</p><h2>Life of Edward Irving</h2><p>The ministry of Edward Irving in London, from its dramatic beginning in 1822 to its tragic close in 1834, when the preacher was only 42, became a talking-point of the 19th Century. An two of the ablest literary figures of the last century, Margaret Oliphant and Thomas Carlyle, ensured that the memory of those remarkable years would not be lost. Arnold Dallimore, the biographer of George Whitefield, came to the conviction that although much has been written on Irving since Oliphant and Carlyle, there was need for a new popular account. Strangely, the same spiritual issues which were raised by Irving&#39;s ministry have again become prominent in recent years. This Life of Irving is an easily read and moving story, told with sympathy and honesty. It also seeks to deal accurately with the extraordinary claims which became associated with Irving&#39;s later ministry. Certainly Irving drew the affection of most of the evangelical Christians who knew him. R.M. M&#39;Cheyne, for instance, could write, &#39;I look back on him with awe, as on the saints and martyrs of old&#39;. Yet the distinctive features of Irving&#39;s ministry caused considerable alarm among the evangelicaly churches. The author reveals the reasons why, as well as giving a gripping portrait of this remarkable man.</p><p>Arnold A. Dallimore, a retired Baptist preacher, now devotes his time to writing. He is well-known for his biographies of George Whitefield, C. H. Spurgeon, and Charles Wesley.</p><h2>LORDS OF THE NORTH-LAST KIN_PB</h2><p>Lords of the North</p><p><p>The third installment of Bernard Cornwell&#x2019;s bestselling series chronicling the epic saga of the making of England, &#x201c;like Game of Thrones, but real&#x201d; (<em>The Observer</em>, London)&#x2014;the basis for&nbsp;<em>The Last Kingdom</em>, the hit BBC America television series.</p><p>After achieving victory at King Alfred&#x2019;s side, Uhtred of Bebbanburg is returning to his home in the North, finally free of his allegiance to the King&#x2014;or so he believes.

Forrest Church challenges much of the modern search for meaning-indeed, the entire thrust of modern theology.</p><p><b>Forrest Church </b>(1948-2009) served for almost three decades as senior minister and was minister of public theology at All Souls Unitarian Church in New York City. He wrote or edited twenty-five books, including <i>Love &amp; Death</i>.Church, senior minister at the distinguished All Souls Unitarian Church in Manhattan, serves up some thoughtful, brief meditations on making life more meaningful. In Unitarian fashion, the book is replete with provisional, qualified statements about God and acknowledgments of the contextualized nature of all truth. There's no dogma here; readers will find gentle anecdotes drawn from Western philosophy, music and art, as well as from Church's own life and experience. The son of a U.S. senator and the grandson (on his mother's side) of the governor of Idaho, the once-agnostic Church surprised himself and his family by choosing parish ministry as his vocation. He states that life becomes more meaningful when we intentionally divide it up into various projectsAthe parenting project, the career project, the God project, and so onAand prioritize those based on our own situations. Those situations will change, and we must change with them, Church asserts, citing a touching example of a professional football player who quit the NFL to spend time with his terminally ill preschool-age son. At the book's close, Church prods those who feel stuck in a rut to simply "turn the page," much as readers who find themselves reading the same paragraph many times without paying attention need to move on. Church does not offer earth-shattering advice here, but readers will be comforted and perhaps challenged by his call for self-examination.

What does it mean when football becomes so central to our private and political lives? Has it enriched us or impoverished us? In this sparkling book David Goldblatt argues that no social phenomenon tracks the momentous economic, social and political changes of the post-Thatcherite era in a more illuminating manner than football, and no cultural practice sheds more light on the aspirations and attitudes of our long boom and now calamitous bust. A must-read for the thinking football fan, The Game of Our Lives will appeal to readers of Fever Pitch by Nick Hornby and Inverting the Pyramid by Jonathan Wilson. It will also be relished by readers of British social history such as Austerity Britain by David Kynaston. &#39;Goldblatt doesn&#39;t just understand the social context of the game. He also has a nose for the best stories&#39; Simon Kuper on The Ball Is Round David Goldblatt is the author of The Ball Is Round: A Global History of Football (Penguin, 2007), the definitive historical account of the world&#39;s game, and of Futebol Nation (Penguin, 2014), a highly acclaimed footballing history of Brazil. For a number of years he wrote a sports column in Prospect magazine and has made a number of documentaries for BBC Radio 4 and for the World Service, including ones on football in Jerusalem and the politics of the game in Kenya. He has also taught the sociology of sport at the University of Bristol, at De Montfort University, Leicester, and at Pitzer College, Los Angeles.

Goldblatt is not merely the best football historian writing today, he is possibly the best there has ever been. Goldblatt's book could hardly be more impressive -- Dominic Sandbrook * Sunday Times * Offers an enlightening, enriching experience. It is based on a formidable range of sources, personal observation and a pleasingly sardonic turn of phrase. Not all football writers know their stuff, let alone the socio-economic context, but Goldblatt does. Altogether this is an exceptional book -- David Kynaston * Guardian * Not just the best soccer book in many years but an exemplary account of the changing character of British society in the post-Thatcher era -- David Runciman * Wall Street Journal * David Goldblatt examines [English football] peerlessly ... A superb history of a sport and of a nation * Evening Standard * Goldblatt is a trusted guide ... Rich with statistics, this is an admirably balanced account of the beautiful game * Daily Mail * Prodigious research and a fluent writing style ... this is a fine book which should have an appeal much beyond the game -- Mihir Bose * Independent * An encyclopaedic portrait of English football stripped of all the non-stop hype. The beautiful game is, after all, a dirty business * Financial Times (Life &amp; Arts) * An intensely readable socioeconomic study of English football in the age of globalisation * New Statesman * A book that informs and inspires, a truly great piece of writing * Philosophy Football * The best pub talker of a book for years * Sunday Sport * Goldblatt has a gift for exploring the way the game holds a mirror up to our lives ...

In Lucky Billy, John Vernon digs into the historical record to find a truth more remarkable than the legend.</p><p>Billy the Kid met his end at the hands of Pat Garrett, his one-time partner, turned sheriff. In Vernon's telling, the key event of Billy's life was the Lincoln County War, a conflict between a ring of Irishmen and a newcomer from England, John Tunstall, who wanted to break their grip on the town. Billy signed on with Tunstall, and when the conflict spun out of control and Tunstall was murdered, an obscure hired gun became Billy the Kid.</p></p><p>John Vernon is the author of the novels La Salle, Lindbergh&#39;s Son, Peter Doyle, and All for Love: Baby Doe and Silver Dollar. The recipient of two NEA fellowships, he teaches at SUNY Binghamton. His work has been published in Harper&#39;s Magazine, the New York Times Book Review, The Los Angeles Times, New York Newsday, and The Nation. The author currently resides in Vestal, New York.<b>H</b>ello, Bob."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bob Olinger looks up at Billy in the window and freezes on the spot. He&#x2019;s a large man of vinegar aspect, a burly, dumb, squint-eyed giant with red hair, curiously infantile features, meaty hands, reeking breath, and, the Kid knows, a heart of pure lead. Two years ago he murdered Billy&#x2019;s old friend John Jones by shaking Jones&#x2019;s right hand with his left and squeezing it tight, which prevented Jones from drawing, and shooting him cold. Now he&#x2019;s a deputy sheriff in Lincoln. There&#x2019;s just no keeping some men down. For the record, his first name is not Bob but Ameredith, inflicted on him by a patriotic mother who wanted a girl. It was only yesterday that Bob had told the Kid he had no more chance of escaping under <i>his </i>guard than of going to heaven. Thanks for the <i>aviso, </i>Bob. From his perch in the window, Billy spots the prisoners Bob had escorted to the Wortley Hotel across the street watching from the hotel grounds. They won&#x2019;t flee, he knows, even after Bob&#x2019;s killed, for unlike the Kid they are trustees, they&#x2019;ve even been allowed to wear their weapons at the courthouse, since their acquittal is all but assured. No court in New Mexico will convict five men for killing four others who&#x2019;d fired on them first in a dispute over precious water rights not when the accused men&#x2019;s alfalfa fields needed irrigation. They&#x2019;re being held at the courthouse in the room still referred to as Mrs. Lloyd&#x2019;s room, named for Lawrence Murphy&#x2019;s former housekeeper. And Billy&#x2019;s being held, or was long enough for him to savor the irony, in the late Lawrence Murphy&#x2019;s bedroom, for the Lincoln County Courthouse not that long ago was the Murphy-Dolan store, headquarters of the Irish ring against which he&#x2019;d fought for the last four years. They&#x2019;d started this mess. They&#x2019;d killed John Tunstall. Dolan and his crew had once disarmed the Kid right here in the store and made him eat crow, and now look at him! It <i>was </i>the only two-story building in Lincoln, that&#x2019;s why he can look down at poor Bob for a change instead of the latter toploftily sizing up his famous prisoner shackled to the floor before kicking his slats, as he&#x2019;d done every morning for the past seven days when it was wakeup time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yesterday, when Sheriff Garrett left for White Oaks to order up the wood for the Kid&#x2019;s gallows, he&#x2019;d double-checked Billy&#x2019;s shackles, called his deputies in, Olinger and Jim Bell, and warned them to be especially vigilant. If he&#x2019;s shown the slightest chance, if he&#x2019;s even allowed the use of one hand, if he&#x2019;s not watched at every moment, he&#x2019;ll effect some plan to murder the both of you and escape. Lip-labor, said Bob after Garrett left. The sheriff ought to save his spit. Bob&#x2019;s response to his boss&#x2019;s absence was to gloat over Billy, to taunt him all the more. Wake up, dearie, potty-time, dearie, can I get you something, dearie? The Kid in turn had greeted the two deputies at breakfast that morning, <i>Ameredith </i>and the more pleasant Jim Bell, with a cheerful "Morning, girls." They passed the time by playing poker in the sheriff&#x2019;s office. "I never did enjoy killing a person," Bob said as he dealt.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I did."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I&#x2019;d love to kill you. It would give me great pleasure."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is that so."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bob poured himself his first midday whiskey. Usually when the bottle was half drunk he offered Jim some. And Jim in turn, if Olinger had to use the privy, would wait until Bob had left the room and, due to the short chain on the Kid&#x2019;s manacles, hold the bottle to his mouth. Is there kindness in hell? Jim asked Bob, "What do you mean you never did enjoy it?"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I never had a weakness for it. It didn&#x2019;t take with me."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Didn&#x2019;t take?" Billy said. "You make it sound like the cow pox."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is it then, sweetheart?"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It&#x2019;s just pulling a trigger. You&#x2019;re the messenger, that&#x2019;s all. The bullet was assigned and fired long ago, before you ever come along."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bell said, "That&#x2019;s a crazy idea." &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about you?" Bob asked Billy. "Was your bullet assigned?" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Everyone&#x2019;s was. You can&#x2019;t duck it, either." &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You&#x2019;ve ducked plenty."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They weren&#x2019;t mine."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In other words, do I have this straight? The bullet you dodge isn&#x2019;t yours. But the one you don&#x2019;t is. That&#x2019;s there&#x2019;s a name for that. It&#x2019;s un-American. No matter what you do, it just had to be. That&#x2019;s a pissant philosophy."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I&#x2019;ll tell you why," said Billy. "My stepfather said it. Your bullet&#x2019;s coming after you all through your life. It follows you around, takes every turn you take. Spend too long in any one place, sleep too much, it&#x2019;s bound to catch up."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I myself sleep a lot."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It&#x2019;s best to keep moving. <i>Look out!</i>"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Olinger jumped up, knocking over his chair. He threw his cards on the table. "You little cunt-garbage," he hissed. "Back to your hole, maggot!"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Shoot me, Bob, and get it over with."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I&#x2019;ll get it over with! I&#x2019;ll get it over with!" With one arm, he grabbed Billy&#x2019;s chains and dragged him out the door to the head of the stairs. The other held his ten-gauge Whitneyville shotgun. "Go ahead. Run." He released his prisoner, opened the shotgun and looked inside the breech, then closed it with a <i>shlang.</i><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>"How can I run with these shackles?"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You&#x2019;ll run if I tell you." He kicked him in the ass and Billy slid down the stairs, protecting his face by skidding on his elbows, and managed to break the fall halfway down. Then he turned and mounted the steep flight of stairs with baby steps enforced by the heavy shackles. "I was hoping you&#x2019;d do it," said Bob. "If you&#x2019;d of just reached the landing I would have blasted you to hell. I&#x2019;d love to see you make a run for it. They would have to collect the little pieces in a jar."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"I wouldn&#x2019;t give you the satisfaction."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In that case, my satisfaction shall be watching you hang. I&#x2019;ll be right in front with a smile on my face."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That&#x2019;s a lie and you know it. You never smiled in your life."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Lesnett on her walks past the courthouse heard these daily altercations. She&#x2019;d once hidden the Kid in a grain bin in her barn during the Lincoln County War. When she walked by that afternoon, Bob, to cool off, had wandered out onto the balcony and lit up a cheroot while Bell and the Kid, with Bob&#x2019;s half-empty bottle to pilfer, resumed playing cards inside. Bob shouted down, "Annie! Mrs. Lesnett! You ought to come to the hanging. Watch his neck stretch. You used to cook for him, ain&#x2019;t it?"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He&#x2019;s a nice boy."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And your husband didn&#x2019;t know. You hid him in a mash barrel, I heard, lest the Dolans burn you out."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You should mind your own business."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, come to the hanging. It will be fun."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And from inside the courthouse Billy&#x2019;s voice shouted: "If I&#x2019;m not there they can&#x2019;t hang me!" <p></p></p><h2>Jimi Hendrix: Electric Gypsy</h2><p>September 18, 1995, marks the 25th anniversary of Jimi Hendrix&#39;s untimely demise.

In addition to a 500-page biography, this Hendrix cornucopia offers all the bells and whistles of a 100-page discography, with over 200 photographs, mementos and pieces of correspondence, a detailed chronology, and a unique appendix delineating Hendrix's guitars, equipment, and playing techniques, all of which contain sumptuous notes. Of the Hendrix mystique and deification since his death at age 27 in 1970, the authors write, "it would be a fitting tribute to Jimi's memory if his substance could begin to predominate over his image." Shapiro and Glebbeek have made a contribution of inestimable value toward this goal. One of the year's best popular music biographies and a mandatory purchase for all libraries. Previewed in Prepub Alert, LJ 3/1/91.<br><i>- Barry Miller, Austin P.L., Tex.</i><br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.Sympathetic and comprehensive, this biography of left-handed guitar wizard Jimi Hendrix (1942-1970) features an exhaustive Hendrix discography, a list of his equipment and a file of film and photo appearances. Shapiro ( Waiting for the Man: Drugs and Popular Music ) and Glebbeek, founder of the Hendrix Information Centre in Ireland, regale the reader with quotes, anecdotes, song analyses and mini-bios of Hendrix colleagues, including the Jimi Hendrix Experience's drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding. The musician is portrayed as a perfectionist, brilliant composer whose imaginative sound effects were limited only by equipment; a black artist under pressure from radical black groups because his audience was predominantly white; a dedicated guitarist overwhelmed by his lifestyle. Hendrix's drug abuse and death from a probable barbiturate overdose are not sensationalized as the authors concentrate on his formidable music legacy, flamboyant individualism and sense of humor.

In this book it&#39;s bedtime for five little rabbits. They come in from outdoors, have a snack, brush their teeth, take a bath, put on nightclothes, and listen to a story before being tucked in for the night. Outside, we see snowflakes falling. In the bunnies&#39; home, all is warmth and coziness and playfulness and love. Four words per spread narrate the evening routine, and delightfully soft and spirited illustrations take readers into the bunnies&#39; world. Young children who have this book as a bedtime companion are lucky indeed, especially if their own getting-ready-for-bed rituals are as familiar and tender as those of the five bunnies.</p><p>Wendy Watson has&nbsp;illustrated more than one hundred books for children, many of which she also wrote. A longtime Vermont resident, she now divides her time between Phoenix, Arizona, and Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Her web site is www.wendy-watson.com.PreS-Gr 1&#x2013;This minimally worded story begins with five scampering bunnies being called inside one autumn evening by their parents. In addition to the falling leaves, the youngsters notice that it is also beginning to snow. The youngest takes part in all of his siblings' activities, but with his eyes always on the window and the falling flakes. Eating dinner, bathing, brushing teeth, donning pajamas, and listening to stories, the energetic bunnies are always in motion. No more than four onomatopoeic words per page aptly describe the scenes: &#x201c;Chomp, Munch, Gobble, Crunch,&#x201d; while the soft-focus illustrations, done in watercolors, acrylics, and pencil, depict a happy, old-fashioned family and their cozy home in a hollow tree. Father builds a small snow bunny on the windowsill while the children settle down to sleep, heightening the smallest bunny's anticipation of the coming day and the deep snow. Children will enjoy the warmth and closeness of this charming family.&#x2013;Maryann H. Owen, Racine Public Library, WI. (c) Copyright 2010.

For model collectors, the airliner type, makers name, scale, approximate age and the materials used are detailed for each model illustrated.&nbsp; A short history of significant model-making companies is covered.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br> With the onset of online bookings and the closure of airline offices and travel agents, the use of models is fast vanishing forever. The focus of this book is to preserve this fascinating era when models were a significant marketing tool.

Lawler</b> was born in South Africa in 1939. He had developed a keen interest in aviation from an early age, but in 1952 when the world's first jet airliner, the Comet 1 flew over his home city on a proving flight, his interest was really ignited. He wrote to the BOAC office in Johannesburg asking for a model, and to his great joy he was sent his first professionally made airliner model. In the next seven years he visited all the local airline offices and managed to build a small collection of models. Upon graduation in aeronautical engineering from Bristol University, he joined the sales department of Hawker Siddeley, responsible for marketing the Trident airliner.&nbsp; In 1971 he was seconded to Airbus Industrie to assist in sales of the first wide body twin-jet airliner, the A300, and over the last twenty years he managed sales campaigns for the Airbus airliners in USA. Since retiring in 2004 he has actively pursued his model collecting.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></p><h2>Country Afghans: The Vanessa-Ann Collection</h2><p>Book by Vanessa-Anne Collection</p><p></p><h2>Hans Andersen&#39;s Fairy Tales</h2><p>"Far out to sea the water is as blue as the petals of the loveliest cornflower, and as clear as the purest glass, but it is very deep, deeper than any anchorage chain can reach, and many church towers would have to be put one on top of another to reach from the bottom to the surface of the water.

It is a part of us and yet we spend most of our life running from it. But far from being scary, our dark side holds the promise of a better, more fulfilling life. Our shadow makes itself known every day. It is the reason we get furious over a friend showing up ten minutes late, yell at our parents or kids when they have done nothing wrong, and sabotage our own success at the worst possible time. Until we are able to embrace our dualistic nature, we will continue to hurt ourselves and those closest to us and fall short of our potential.</p><p>Combining the wisdom of three experts, <em>The Shadow Effect</em> is a practical and profound guide to discovering the gifts of our shadow.

I don&#x2019;t mean the kind cops solve or the ones you read about in novels or watch on television or on a movie screen. I&#x2019;m not talking about the mystery of Creation, either, or the unseen presences that reside perhaps just the other side of the physical world. I&#x2019;m talking about evil, without capitalization but evil all the same, the kind whose origins sociologists and psychiatrists have trouble explaining.<br> <br>Police officers keep secrets, not unlike soldiers who return from foreign battlefields with a syndrome that survivors of the Great War called the thousand-yard stare. I believe that the account of the apple taken from the forbidden tree is a metaphorical warning about looking too deeply into the darker potential of the human soul. The photographs of the inmates at Bergen-Belsen or Andersonville Prison or the bodies in the ditch at My Lai disturb us in a singular fashion because those instances of egregious human cruelty were committed for the most part by baptized Christians. At some point we close the book containing photographs of this kind and put it away and convince ourselves that the events were an aberration, the consequence of leaving soldiers too long in the field or letting a handful of misanthropes take control of a bureaucracy. It is not in our interest to extrapolate a larger meaning.<br> <br>Hitler, Nero, Ted Bundy, the Bitch of Buchenwald?

There are certain burdens you do not visit on people of goodwill.<br> <br>When I was in plainclothes at the NOPD, I used to deal with problems such as these in a saloon on Magazine Street, not far from the old Irish Channel. With its brass-railed bar and felt-covered bouree tables and wood-bladed fans, it became my secular church where the Louisiana of my youth, the green-gold, mossy, oak-shaded world of Bayou Teche, was only one drink away. I would start with four fingers of Jack in a thick mug, with a sweating Budweiser back, and by midnight I would be alone at the end of the bar, armed, drunk, and hunched over my glass, morally and psychologically insane.<br> <br>I had come to feel loathing and disgust with the mythology that characterized the era in which I lived. I didn&#x2019;t &#x201c;serve&#x201d; in Southeast Asia; I &#x201c;survived&#x201d; and watched innocent people and better men than I die in large numbers while I was spared by a hand outside myself. I didn&#x2019;t &#x201c;serve and protect&#x201d; as a police officer; I witnessed the justice system&#x2019;s dysfunction and the government&#x2019;s empowerment of corporations and the exploitation of those who had no political voice. And while I brooded on all that was wrong in the world, I continued to stoke the furnace inside me with Black Jack and Smirnoff&#x2019;s and five-star Hennessy and, finally, two jiggers of Scotch inside a glass of milk at sunrise, constantly suppressing my desire to lock down on my enemies with the .45 automatic I had purchased in Saigon&#x2019;s brothel district and with which I slept as I would a woman.<br> <br>My real problem wasn&#x2019;t the militarization of my country or any of the other problems I&#x2019;ve mentioned. The real problem went back to a mystery that had beset me since the destruction of my natal home and family. My father, Big Aldous, was on the monkey board of an offshore drilling well when the drill bit punched into an early pay sand and a spark jumped off the wellhead and a mushroom of flaming oil and natural gas rose through the rigging like an inferno ballooning from the bottom of an elevator shaft. My mother, Alafair Mae Guillory, was seduced and blackmailed by a gambler and pimp named Mack, whom I hated more than any human being I ever knew, not because he turned her into a barroom whore but because of the Asian men I killed in his stead.<br> <br>Rage and bloodlust and alcoholic blackouts became the only form of serenity I knew. From Saigon to the Philippines, from Chinatown in Los Angeles to the drunk tanks of New Orleans, the same questions haunted me and gave me no rest. Were some people made different in the womb, born without a conscience, intent on destroying everything that was good in the world? Or could a black wind blow the weather vane in the wrong direction for any of us and reshape our lives and turn us into people we no longer recognized? I knew there was an answer out there someplace, if I could only drink myself into the right frame of mind and find it.<br> <br>I stayed ninety-proof for many years and got a bachelor&#x2019;s degree in self-immolation and a doctorate in chemically induced psychosis. When I finally entered sobriety, I thought the veil might be lifted and I would find answers to all the Byzantine riddles that had confounded me.<br> <br>That was not to be the case. Instead, a man who was one of the most wicked creatures on earth made his way into our lives. This is a tale that maybe I shouldn&#x2019;t share. But it&#x2019;s not one I want to keep inside me, either.<br> <br>MY ADOPTED DAUGHTER, Alafair Robicheaux, jogged up a logging road that wound through ponderosa pine and Douglas fir and cedar trees atop a ridge overlooking a two-lane highway and a swollen creek far below. The highway had been built on the exact trail that Meriwether Lewis and William Clark had followed over Lolo Pass into present-day Idaho and, eventually, to the Pacific Ocean in the year 1805. They had not been able to accomplish this feat on their own. After they and their men had sliced their moccasins to ribbons trying to make portage with their canoes through several canyons on a fork of the Columbia River, a Shoshone woman by the name of Sacagawea showed them a route that took them up a gentle slope, past the base of Lolo Peak, into the country of the Nez Perce and the spotted horses called the Appaloosa.<br> <br>As Alafair jogged along the dirt road that had been graded through timber by a bulldozer, the wind blowing cool out of the trees, the western sun blazing on the fresh snow that had fallen the previous night on Lolo Peak, she wondered at the amount of history that had been changed by one brave woman, because Sacagawea not only showed the Lewis and Clark party the way to Oregon, she saved them from starvation and being slaughtered by a rogue band of Nez Perce.<br> <br>Alafair was listening to a song on her iPod when she felt a stinging sensation on her left ear. She also felt a puff of air against her cheek and the touch of a feather on her skin. Without stopping, she swatted at her hair and pressed her hand against her ear and then looked at it. There was a bright smear of blood on her palm. Above, she saw two ravens glide into the boughs of a ponderosa and begin cawing at the sky.<br> <br>She continued up the logging road, her breath coming hard in her throat, until she reached the top of the ridge. Then she turned and began the descent, her knees jarring on the grade, the sun moving behind Lolo Peak, the reflected light disappearing from the surface of the creek. She touched her ear again, but the cut she believed a raven had inflicted was no longer bleeding and felt like little more than a scratch. That was when she saw the aluminum shaft of a feathered arrow embedded three inches deep in a cedar snag that had been scorched and hardened in a fire.<br> <br>She slowed to a stop, her heart beating hard, and looked over her shoulder. The logging road was in shadow, the border of trees so thick she could no longer feel the wind or see where the sun was. The air smelled like snow, like the coming of winter rather than summer. She took off her earbuds and listened. She heard the crackling of limbs and rocks sliding down a slope. A big doe, a mule deer, no more than twenty yards away, jumped a pile of dirt and landed squarely in the middle of the road, its gray winter coat unchanged by spring.<br> <br>&#x201c;Is there a bow hunter out there?&#x201d; Alafair shouted.<br> <br>There was no answer.<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s no bow season in western Montana in the spring. At least not for deer,&#x201d; she called out.<br> <br>There was no response except the sweep of the wind in the trees, a sound like the rushing of floodwater in a dry riverbed. She ran her finger along the arrow and touched the feathers at the base. The aluminum shaft bore no trace of dirt or bird droppings or even dust. The feathers were clean and stiff when she ran the ball of her thumb along their edges.<br> <br>&#x201c;If you made a mistake and you&#x2019;re sorry, just come out and apologize,&#x201d; she yelled. &#x201c;Who shot this arrow?&#x201d;<br> <br>The doe bounced away from her, almost like a kangaroo. The shadows had grown so dark inside the border of the trees that the deer was indistinguishable except for the patch of white hair under its tail. Unconsciously, Alafair pulled on her cut earlobe and studied the trees and the orange glow in the west that indicated the sun would set in the next ten minutes. She fitted both hands on the shaft of the arrow and jerked it from the cedar trunk. The arrowhead was made of steel and was bright and slick with a thin sheen of oil, and flanged and wavy on the edges, which had been honed as sharp as a razor.<br> <br>She made her way back down the ridge, almost to the bottom, then walked out on a rocky point that formed a V and jutted into space and was devoid of trees and second growth. Below she saw a broad-shouldered man with a narrow waist, wearing Wranglers and a white straw hat and a bandanna tied around his neck. He had on a navy blue long-sleeved shirt buttoned at the wrists, with white stars embroidered on the shoulders and purple garters on his upper arms, the kind an exotic dancer might wear on her thighs. He was latching the door on the camper shell inserted in the bed of his pickup truck. &#x201c;Hey, buddy!&#x201d; Alafair said. &#x201c;I want a word with you.&#x201d;<br> <br>He turned slowly, lifting his head, a solitary ray of sunlight pooling under his hat brim. Even though the glare must have been intense, he didn&#x2019;t blink. He was a white man with the profile of an Indian and eyes that seemed made of glass and contained no color other than the sun&#x2019;s refracted brilliance. His complexion made her think of the rind on a cured ham. &#x201c;Why, howdy-doody,&#x201d; he said, an idiot&#x2019;s grin painted on his mouth. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;d a cute little heifer like you come from?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Does this arrow belong to you?&#x201d; she asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take it if you don&#x2019;t want it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Did you shoot this fucking arrow at me or not?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I cain&#x2019;t hear very good in the wind. What was that word you used?&#x201d; He cupped one hand to his ear. &#x201c;Want to come down here and talk?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Somebody almost killed me with this arrow.&#x201d;<br> <br>He removed the thin stub of a cigar from his shirt pocket and lit it with a paper match, cupping the flame in his hands, then making a big show of shaking out the match. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a truck stop next to the casino. I&#x2019;ll buy you a Coca-Cola. They got showers there if you want one.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Was that a bow you were putting in your camper? You owe me an answer.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;My name is Mr. Wyatt Dixon of Fort Davis, Texas. I&#x2019;m a bullfighter and a handler of rough stock and a born-again Christian. What do you think of them apples? Come on down, girl. I ain&#x2019;t gonna bite.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I think you need to get out of here.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;This is the home of the brave and the land of the free, and God bless you for your exercise of your First Amendment rights. But I only pretended I didn&#x2019;t hear what you said. Profanity does not behoove your gender. Know who said that? Thomas Jefferson did, yessiree-bobtail.&#x201d;<br> <br>His teeth looked like they were cut out of whalebone. His whole body seemed wired with levels of energy and testicular power he could barely control. Even though his posture was relaxed, his knuckles were as hard-looking as ball bearings. &#x201c;Are you deciding about my invite, or has the cat got your tongue?&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>She wanted to answer him, but the words wouldn&#x2019;t come. He removed his hat and drew a pocket comb through his silky red hair, tilting up his chin. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a student of accents. You&#x2019;re from somewhere down south. See you down the track, sweet thing. If I was you, I&#x2019;d stay out of them woods. You cain&#x2019;t ever tell what&#x2019;s roaming around in there.&#x201d;<br> <br>He let a semi carrying a huge piece of oil machinery pass, then got in his truck and drove away. She felt a rivulet of moisture leak from her sweatband and run down her cheek. A sour odor rose from under her arms.<br> <br>IN THE EARLY spring Alafair and my wife, Molly, and my old partner from NOPD, Clete Purcel, had returned to western Montana with plans to spend the summer on a ranch owned by a novelist and retired English professor whose name was Albert Hollister. Albert had built a three-story house of logs and quarried rock on a knoll overlooking a railed pasture to the north and another to the south. It was a fine home, rustic but splendid in concept, a bucolic citadel where Albert could continue to wage war against the intrusions of the Industrial Age. When his beloved Asian wife died, I suspected the house she had helped design rang with an emptiness that drove him almost mad.<br> <br>Albert installed Clete in a guest cabin located at the far end of the property, and the rest of us on the third floor of the house. From the balcony, we had a wonderful view of the wooded foothills that seemed to topple for miles and miles before they reached the Bitterroot Mountains, white and shining as bright as glaciers on the peaks and strung with mist at sunrise. Across from our balcony was a hillside dotted with larch and fir and pine trees and outcroppings of gray rock and traced with arroyos swollen with snowmelt and brown water and pine needles during the runoff in early April.<br> <br>On a shady slope behind the house, Albert had improvised a gun range where we popped big, fat coffee cans that he propped on sticks at the foot of a trail that had been used by Chief Joseph and the Nez Perce when they tried to outrun the United States Army.

Close friends for much of their lives, Ruth Benedict and Margaret Mead met at Barnard College in 1922, when Mead was a student, Benedict a teacher. They became sexual partners (though both married), and pioneered in the then male-dominated discipline of anthropology. They championed racial and sexual equality and cultural relativity despite the generally racist, xenophobic, and homophobic tenor of their era. Mead&#x2019;s best-selling <i>Coming of Age in Samoa</i> (1928) and <i>Sex and Temperament in Three Primitive Societies</i> (1935), and Benedict&#x2019;s<i> Patterns of Culture </i>(1934),<i> Race </i>(1940),<i> </i>and<i> The Chrysanthemum and the Sword </i>(1946), were landmark studies that ensured the lasting prominence and influence of their authors in the field of anthropology and beyond.<br><br>With unprecedented access to the complete archives of the two women&#x2014;including hundreds of letters opened to scholars in 2001&#x2014;Lois Banner examines the impact of their difficult childhoods and the relationship between them in the context of their circle of family, friends, husbands, lovers, and colleagues, as well as the calamitous events of their time. She shows how Benedict inadvertently exposed Mead to charges of professional incompetence, discloses the serious errors New Zealand anthropologist Derek Freeman made in his famed attack on Mead&#x2019;s research on Samoa, and reveals what happened in New Guinea when Mead and colleagues engaged in a ritual aimed at overturning all gender and sexual boundaries.<br><br>In this illuminating and innovative work, Banner has given us the most detailed, balanced, and informative portrait of Mead and Benedict&#x2014;individually and together&#x2014;that we have had.</p><p>"Banner has intertwined not only the lives of Mead and Benedict, but all the assumptions about women and sex in the first half of the twentieth century. The history of anthropology has never been so plainly set forth. An amazing, invaluable, unprecedented book--a delight to read."<br>--Carolyn Heilbrun, author of <i>Writing A Woman's Life</i><br><br>"A most amazing, magnificent, and very moving chronicle of Lesbian brilliance. Lois Banner continues to break down bigoted barriers and write <i>real</i> history."<br>--Larry Kramer, author of <i>The Normal Heart<br></i><br>"<i>Intertwined Lives</i> is a luscious detective story in which Banner ingenuously finds the clues and breaks the codes critical to understanding these two giants of American intellectual life and the bond between them. Banner has written a rich and incisive biography of their relationship, but she has also written a book that helps us make sense of that pivotal cultural shift as the Victorian sexual system gives way to the modern. How did people born into the Victorian world, but coming of age in the modern, negotiate this transition? Here, Banner allows us to see Mead and Benedict up close as they grapple with, even as they help shape, a new order that holds both pleasures and terrors for hem. A canny book and a must-read for anyone interested in the history of sexuality and gender."<br>--Alice Echols, author of <i>Scars of Sweet Paradise: The Life and Times of Janis Joplin<br><br></i>"Margaret Mead and Ruth Benedict loved anthropology, and they loved each other. They concealed that second love during their lifetimes, but left ample clues for a bold and sensitive biographer to recreate the richness of their shared personal and professional lives. Lois Banner is that biographer."<br>-- Susan Ware, editor of <i> Notable American Women<br></i><br>"<i>Intertwined Lives</i> is an enticing and gorgeous adventure story about two brilliant divas, whose intellectual travels also involved extraordinary experiments in friendship and sexual love. Banner's approach to these amazing women is both erudite and wonderfully imaginative."<br>--Christine Stansell, author of <i>American Moderns<br><br></i>"An engrossing narrative....bringing Mead and Benedict to life and placing<br>then with their circle of friends in a lovely mosaic."<br> -- Christopher Carbone, <i>Washington Post Book World<br><br></i>"A brilliant introduction to two women who stood in the vanguard of a new America."<br> --Jamie Spencer, <i>St. Louis Post-Dispatch<br><br></i>"A major work, impressive in its depth and breadth."<br> -- Joan Gartland, <i>Library Journal<br></i>Lois Banner has taught at Rutgers University, Princeton University, the University of Scranton, Hamilton College, the University of Maryland, and George Washington University.

But there is more than one sort of luck. To fall prey to a motor neuron disease is surely to have offended the Gods at some point, and there is nothing more to be said. But if you must suffer thus, better to have a well-stocked head." -Tony Judt </i><br><br><i>The Memory Chalet</i> is a memoir unlike any you have ever read before. Each essay charts some experience or remembrance of the past through the sieve of Tony Judt's prodigious mind. His youthful love of a particular London bus route evolves into a reflection on public civility and interwar urban planning. Memories of the 1968 student riots of Paris meander through the divergent sex politics of Europe, before concluding that his generation "was a revolutionary generation, but missed the revolution." A series of road trips across America lead not just to an appreciation of American history, but to an eventual acquisition of citizenship. Foods and trains and long-lost smells all compete for Judt's attention; but for us, he has forged his reflections into an elegant arc of analysis. All as simply and beautifully arranged as a Swiss chalet-a reassuring refuge deep in the mountains of memory.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, November 2010</strong>: In 2008 Tony Judt, the historian and essayist whose book <em>Postwar</em> was quickly recognized as one of the landmark works of our time, was diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease. He was soon almost fully paralyzed, but before his death in the summer of 2010 he managed to produce not only two works of political and intellectual history, <em>Ill Fares the Land</em> and the upcoming <em>Thinking the Twentieth Century</em>, but also a series of short essays that had a breathtaking reception when they appeared, a few at a time, in the <em>New York Review of Books</em>. The pieces were remarkable both for their content and their method of composition: isolated at night in the prison of his paralysis, Judt would sort through his memories, arranging them, to better remember them, in the "rooms" of a Swiss chalet he recalled from an idyllic childhood visit, before dictating them in the morning to be published. The essays are at times political but always personal, calling up memories of food, youth, sex, education, train travel, and other subjects with a clarity and intensity born of both his historian's skills of observation and judgment and the heightened awareness of time's passage imposed by his undeniable mortality. Collected now in <em>The Memory Chalet</em>, these reflections make up a memoir that evokes, with clear-eyed passion, the life of the mind, as well as the body. <em>--Tom Nissley</em><br>Tony Judt was the Erich Maria Remarque Professor of European Studies at New York University, as well as the founder and director of the Remarque Institute, dedicated to creating an ongoing conversation between Europe and the United States.

Following the introduction, which reveals the author's approach and salient background on the book, each chapter of the commentary provides the Scripture to be exposited. The New King James Bible has been chosen for the Preacher's Commentary because it combines with integrity the beauty of language, underlying Hebrew and Greek textual basis, and thought-flow of the 1611 King James Version, while replacing obsolete verb forms and other archaisms with their everyday contemporary counterparts for greater readability. Reverence for God is preserved in the capitalization of all pronouns referring to the Father, Son, or Holy Spirit. Readers who are more comfortable with another translation can readily find the parallel passage by means of the chapter and verse reference at the end of each passage being exposited. The paragraphs of exposition combine fresh insights to the Scripture, application, rich illustrative material, and innovative ways of utilizing the vibrant truth for his or her own life and for the challenge of communicating it with vigor and vitality.</p></p><p>Larson is author of several books and co-pastor of Crystal Cathedral Congregration in Garden Grove, California.</p><h2>Basic Biomechanics</h2><p>ISBN: 9781260085549 is International Student edition of Basic Biomechanics 8th edition by Susan Hall (Author).

It is a visual narrative of how people lived, thought, and made this great city of the East. With two hundred and eight pages of colourful photographs, the book depicts the multifaceted picture of this great city. Like many other cities of the developing world, Dhaka is a fast-growing metropolis of nearly nine million people, a large proportion of them living in poor, unsanitary conditions. Against this background are the sharply contrasting signs of modernism and affluence: high-rise buildings, automobiles, computers. Dhaka&#39;s four-hundred-year history is a collage of the legacy of the great empires, the Mughal and the British, and of the many foreign interlopers who came to this land spreading their religion or seeking their fortune. After a brief introduction, the pictorial chapters wonder through historic Sonargaon, old Dhaka, Sher-e-Banglanagar, and suburban Dhaka. Dhaka&#39;s attractive bazaars, colourful rickshaws, finely decorated mosques, impressive monuments, traditional lifestyles in the old town and on the banks of the Buriganga river, all appear in beautiful colour photographs, printed on high quality paper, to provide a unique portrait of the city and its people.</p><p></p><h2>Stolen Remains: A Lady of Ashes Mystery</h2><p>After establishing her reputation as one of London's most highly regarded undertakers, Violet Harper decided to take her practice to the wilds of the American West.

What lies beneath&#x2015;the varied and teeming life of animals and plants&#x2015;is vividly portrayed through the cycle of day and night in the jungle world. Considered Helen Borten&#x2019;s masterpiece, <i>The Jungle</i> was inspired by a trip to Guatemala in 1967, when few others were going there&#x2015;let alone a woman&#x2015;to seek out images and stories to share with children back in the US.</p><p>Born in Philadelphia in 1930, Helen Borten attended the Philadelphia Museum College of Art and produced the main body of her children's picture books in the 1960s&#x2015;books for which she received high praise, awards, and much love.<b>A 2018 CBC Hot Off the Press selection</b><br>"With beautiful, clear language, Helen Borten takes children through a single day deep within the Guatemalan rain forest in a reissue of her 1968 picture book, 'The Jungle' ... Matte paper whispers under the fingers as the pages turn to show layered prints and etchings of monkeys and ferns; of the armadillo and the jaguar. 'Under the leafy roof, it is dim and still,' Ms. Borten writes. 'Time seems to have stopped in a wild summer world of long, long ago. Thick vines hang from trees like ropes.' The evocative description of natural things in a natural setting brings to mind the cadences of Robert McCloskey&#x2019;s beloved 1957 picture book, 'Time of Wonder.' With their patient pacing and a sense of quiet reverence, both are books to savor with children ages 3-9."&#x2015;Meghan Cox Gurdon, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i><br>"I was enchanted by the art first, and drawn into the jungle with her verbiage. This is the way to learn about rainforests."&#x2015;<i>Glass of Wine, Glass of Milk</i><br>&#x201d;Borten&#x2019;s lyrical prose deepens the naturally enchanting science of the jungle. As the story unfolds across the hours of the day, we learn about the noisiest animal in the world, about the invisible universe of strange and magnificent nocturnal creatures, about the species composition of the insect orchestra scoring the jungle at dusk. ... In era when the vocabulary of children&#x2019;s imagination is being forcibly robbed of reverence for the wilderness and antiscientific, anti-nature, anti-truth propagandists are hard at work, Borten&#x2019;s children&#x2019;s books emerge not only as beacons of loveliness but also as quiet, steadfast pillars of resistance.&#x201d; &#x2015;Maria Popova, <i>Brain Pickings</i><br>"First published in 1968, this view of a Guatemalan rainforest was the result of a trip Helen Borten took there in 1967... Mixed media compositions printed in Pantone spot colors on ample, uncoated ivory paper illustrate the mystery and beauty of that time that is no longer as climate change and corporate greed destroy the beauty."&#x2015;Katrina Yurenka, <i>Youth Services Book Review</i><br>&#x201d;Discover the jungle&#x2019;s ecosystem, from its leafy rooftop to its soil-rich floor, in Helen Borten&#x2019;s classic work,&nbsp;<i>The Jungle</i>.&nbsp;Readers will encounter orchids, parasol ants, macaws, bamboo, and other flora and fauna of the jungle. The 2018 reprint edition is as visually exhilarating as the original 1968 print.

Mertz Library, New York Botanical Garden<br>&#x201d;In Helen Borten&#x2019;s The Jungle, we slip into the natural world of a dense rainforest. We learn of the flora and fauna who inhabit different layers of the jungle and witness the wonders of wildlife &nbsp;as one simple day passes in nature. Borten uses a mixed media approach to illustration, combining block print with collage to create striking images in earth tones of life in the forrest. She crafts delicate prose that transport the reader to the heart of the jungle. [...] What I love: [...] Borten&#x2019;s layered, &nbsp;mixed media illustrations will enchant both young and old readers.

In the sewers of Deptford, there lurks a dark presence that fills the tunnels with fear. The rats worship it in the blackness and name it &#34;Jupiter, Lord of All.&#34; Into this twilight realm wanders a small and frightened mouse-the unwitting trigger of a chain of events that hurtles the Deptford mice into a world of heroic adventure and terror.</p><p>Robin Jarvis worked in television and advertising before becoming a full-time author and illustrator. His first book, The Dark Portal, was short-listed for the 1989 Smarties Book Prize in England. Mr. Jarvis currently lives in London.Grade 5-9-This animal adventure tale pits a varied cast of mice against sewer-dwelling rats. Commanded by an evil creature named Jupiter, the rat hordes labor on a huge tunnel that will somehow bring their leader great power. Several mice are drawn into the sewer and eventually work together to thwart the project. With multiple protagonists, the action gets disjointed at times. Brave young Audrey gets captured early on, and doesn't reappear until several chapters later, detracting from the tension of her plight. Some characters, like Audrey's brother Arthur, are not developed beyond some basic traits. The action alternates between various mice trying to rescue Audrey and the terrible rats who are caught up in Jupiter's scheme and their own wicked designs. Jupiter himself is a compelling villain, never seen by even his closest henchman, whose magical powers increase as his evil plan unfolds. The best scenes in the novel involve danger and action, often with gruesome details. The rats not only kill mice, they skin and eat them, so the narrow escapes and close calls are exciting, especially the final scene in which the mice finally battle Jupiter. Brian Jacques's "Redwall" series (Philomel) is more tightly plotted and Kenneth Oppel's "Silverwing" books (S &amp; S) are more suspenseful, but The Dark Portal will appeal to fans of both.<br><i>Steven Engelfried, Deschutes County Library, Bend, OR </i><br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Manhattan Project</h2><p>Discusses the personalities and events involved in the research, development and detonation of the atomic bombs built by the United States in the 1940s.</p><p>Grade 7-10-A solid recounting of an irrevocable turning point in world history-the creation of the atomic bomb.

He sees music as a vehicle to expand one's consciousness and as the living expression of the divine Consciousness within: "Music means self-expansion and oneness. The self expands through music. The self that expands is not the individual self, but the unlimited self. Music is the expansion of the unlimited reality." <p>Part two explores the use of mantra and japa for spiritual growth and fulfillment. Detailed instructions on their use include specific mantras for spiritual growth, health, wealth and more.</p></p><p><p>Born Chinmoy Kumar Ghose in the small village of Shakpura in East Bengal (now Bangladesh) in 1931, Sri Chinmoy was the youngest of seven children. In 1944, after both his parents had passed away, 12 year-old Chinmoy entered the Sri Aurobindo Ashram, a spiritual community near Pondicherry in South India. Here he spent the next 20 years in spiritual practice - including long hours of meditation, practising athletics, writing poetry, essays and spiritual songs.</p> <p>In his early teens, Chinmoy had many profound inner experiences, and in subsequent years achieved very advanced states of meditation. In 1964, he moved to New York City to share his inner wealth with sincere seekers in the West.</p> <p>Sri Chinmoy sees aspiration - the heart's ceaseless yearning for ever higher and deeper realities - as the spiritual force behind all great advances in religion, culture, sports and science. By living in the heart and aspiring for continual self-transcendence, men and women can bring forward the best in themselves and find their path to true satisfaction. In his words:</p> <p>"Our goal is to go from bright to brighter to brightest, from high to higher to highest. And even in the highest, there is no end to our progress, for God Himself is inside each of us and God at every moment is transcending His own Reality."</p> <p>Sri Chinmoy serves as spiritual guide to students in some 60 countries around the world, encouraging a balanced lifestyle that incorporates the inner disciplines of prayer and meditation with the dynamism of contemporary life.</p> <p>Sri Chinmoy's life was an expression of boundless creativity. His vast output spans the domains of music, poetry, painting, literature and sports. His contributions in each of these fields have been striking and far-reaching.</p> <p>Sri Chinmoy frequently travelled throughout the world to offer free concerts, lectures and public meditations, to meet with his students, and to meet and discuss spirituality with world and community leaders. Sri Chinmoy did not charge a fee for his spiritual guidance, concerts, lectures and public meditations.</p> <p>Sri Chinmoy entered Mahasamadhi - the mystic process through which spiritual Masters leave the body, on the morning of 11 October 2007.</p></p><h2>Milwaukee Then and Now</h2><p>Milwaukee Then and Now matches historic images of the early city with modern photographs that show the city as it is today: a diverse range of architectural styles, including the massive arches of the old Federal Building to the sleek lines of 20th century high-rise offices, and Lake Drive, the home of Milwaukee&#x2019;s largest mansions.</p><p><b>Sandra Ackerman</b> has served as the executive director of Historic Milwaukee, Inc.

The relative ease of the newer techniques involved, along with the publicity which accompanied the commercial aspiration of the manufacturers of electronic music systems, brought about a sudden audience/composer appeal to electronic music. What are the processes the &#34;electronic composer&#34; follows to make a composition? What are the parameters involved in the production of electronic music? What are the available techniques and how do they work? &#34;Conventional music&#34; composers have a number of devices such as homophony, polyphony, inversion, retrograde, dodecophonic systems, tonality, aleatory processes, etc, that they may or may not use in the creation of their art form. In the same way, electronic music composers utilize various techniques and methods, sometimes in combination with &#34;conventional&#34; techniques and sometimes completely apart from those aspects of structuring sound. This book will describe and explain these electronic music techniques for the composer/musician/listener who is not familiar with them, and will discuss, in laymen&#39;s terms, the techniques available to the electronic music composer of this decade.

With more than thirty-five novels to her credit, Muller has received the 2005 Grand Master Award from the Mystery Writers of America, the Private Eye Writers of America Lifetime Achievement Award, a Ridley Award, an American Mystery Award, and the Anthony Award.</p>San Francisco detective Sharon McCone ( The Shape of Dread ) uncovers murderous passions still simmering from the Vietnam anti-war movement when she undertakes an investigation into why a sniper victim changed his will to disinherit his children and leave more than $1 million to four strangers. Helping Hank Zahn, her boss at the All Souls Legal Cooperative, in settling the estate of his old Vietnam buddy, accountant Perry Hilderly, a founder of the Berkeley Free Speech Movement, Sharon tracks down the four beneficiaries, all of whom have ties to a collective involved in a bombing attempt at a naval station in the late 1960s. When one, a sleazy lawyer, is murdered, and a sniper almost kills Hank and another Vietnam vet, Sharon must find the connection between the murders, despite strident resistance from the police investigator in charge of the cases. McCone is one of the most freshly conceived and complexly characterized of the female private eyes. Muller's fine eye for detail and sense of place bring San Francisco and the California subculture vividly to life while Sharon unravels the skeins of a complex case to arrive at unhappy truths. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Ultimate House Book: For Home Design in the Twenty-First Century</h2><p>Three years into the new millennium, Sir Terence Conran has once again reinvented his concept of home design, now a harmonious blur between public and private living with a soupcon of professionalism.

The significance of the newly added word&nbsp;<i>home</i>&nbsp;in the title should not be overlooked, as the author has gravitated toward LeCorbusier's 1927 statement: "Everybody, quite rightly, dreams of sheltering himself in a sure and permanent home of his own."&nbsp;<i>Ultimate</i>&nbsp;appeals to this primal notion of belonging, starting with an aspirational, visual introduction before separating ideas into three distinct sections: home life, or the different stages of design, from first house to empty nest; home work, exploring all options for decorating, from paint versus plaster to remodeling versus new construction; and compendium, the nitty-gritty information so necessary to understanding and making design choices.

In this eloquent and deeply personal book, a distinguished scholar reflects on the character and aims of the university, assessing its guiding principles, its practical functions, and its role in society.<br>Jaroslav Pelikan provides a unique perspective on the university today by reexamining it in light of John Henry Cardinal Newman's 150-year-old classic The Idea of a University and showing how Cardinal Newman's ideas both illuminate and differ from current problems facing higher education. Pelikan begins by affirming the validity of Newman's first principle: that knowledge must be an end in itself. He goes on to make the case for the inseparability of research and teaching on both intellectual and practical grounds, stressing the virtues--free inquiry, scholarly honesty, civility in discourse, toleration of diverse beliefs and values, and trust in rationality and public verifiability--that must be practiced and taught by the university. He discusses the business of the university--the advancement of knowledge through research, the extension and interpretation of knowledge through undergraduate and graduate teaching, the preservation of knowledge in libraries, museums, and galleries, and the diffusion of knowledge through scholarly publishing. And he argues that by performing these tasks, by developing closer ties with other schools at all levels, and by involving the community in lifelong education, the university will make its greatest contribution to society.</p><p><p><b>Jaroslav Pelikan </b>is Sterling Professor of History at Yale University. He is the author of, among other books, <i>The Christian Tradition </i>and <i>Jesus Through the Centuries</i>. His scholarly accomplishments have been recognized by medals and awards from many scholarly societies and institutions, by honorary degrees from universities all over the world, and by the Jefferson Award of the National Endowment for the Humanities, the highest honor conferred by the Federal Government on a scholar in the Humanities.</p>Pelikan ( The Christian Tradition ), professor of history at Yale, here conducts an "ongoing dialogue with one book," John Henry Cardinal Newman's The Idea of a University . Written more than 150 years ago by the towering 19th century thinker whose efforts to establish a Catholic university in Dublin were cruelly frustrated, Newman's book offers illuminating parallels to, and contrasts, current university crises, and Pelikan draws attention to these in the present work. He adheres to the format of Newman's discourses, embracing their theological as well as scholarly dimensions as he seeks to characterize the university's aims, functions, and place in society. He considers the interrelations of knowledge and utility, the conflict between ideology and pluralism and the need for community felt by teachers and students--concerns as pressing in Newman's day as they are now. Shaped by Pelikan's personal identification with Newman, whom he calls "the most influential English-speaking theologian who ever lived," this reflective book should be required reading for shapers of the university, and will be a powerful stimulus for readers who wish to reacquaint themselves with Newman. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Furies: War in Europe, 1450&#x2013;1700</h2><p><p>We think of the Renaissance as a shining era of human achievement-a pinnacle of artistic genius and humanist brilliance, the time of Shakespeare, Michelangelo, and Montaigne. Yet it was also an age of constant, harrowing warfare. Armies, not philosophers, shaped the face of Europe as modern nation-states emerged from feudal society. In <i>Furies</i>, one of the leading scholars of Renaissance history captures the dark reality of the period in a gripping narrative mosaic.</p><p> As Lauro Martines shows us, &#x201c;total war&#x201d; was no twentieth-century innovation. These conflicts spared no civilians in their path. A Renaissance army was a mobile city-indeed, a force of twenty thousand or forty thousand men was larger than many cities of the day. And it was a monster, devouring food and supplies for miles around. It menaced towns and the countryside-and itself-with famine and disease, often more lethal than combat. Fighting itself was savage, its violence increased by the use of newly invented weapons, from muskets to mortars.</p><p> For centuries, notes Martines, the history of this period has favored diplomacy, &#x201c;high politics,&#x201d; and military tactics. <i>Furies</i> puts us on the front lines of battle, and on the streets of cities under siege, to reveal what Europe's wars meant to the men and women who endured them.</p></p><p><b>Lauro Martines</b> is one of the world's foremost historians of the Italian Renaissance and early modern Europe. He is the author of nine books, most recently the critically acclaimed <i>Fire in the City: Savonarola and the Struggle for Renaissance Florence</i> and <i>April Blood: Florence and the Plot Against the Medici</i>. Born in Chicago, he was a professor of history at UCLA. He now lives in London with his wife, the novelist Julia O'Faolain.Unlucky were civilians of early modern Europe in the path of an army on the march or in a city under siege. No safer were soldiers, more apt to die from disease and starvation than battle. Vignettes of horror from the era&#x2019;s maelstroms, grandly titled the Thirty Years&#x2019; War or the Dutch Revolt, abound in Martines&#x2019; treatment, which tries to raise ethical questions about panoramas of war. Discounting princes&#x2019; justifications for war, which come across as aristocratic brigandage in his text, Martines sets aside conventional military history of campaigns and leaders to show the hand of Mars on the peasants and villagers it touched. It coerced them into armies, but Mars&#x2019; royal sponsors failed to render promised pay and supplies. To square accounts, their generals instead let soldiers pillage the countryside and sack cities, examples Martines draws from eyewitnesses to plunder, arson, and killing. Ending by asking historians&#x2014;he is a specialist on Renaissance Florence&#x2014;to consider morality in their political and military works about the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, Martines poises an agenda atop graphic historical envisioning of what he decries. --Gilbert Taylor</p><h2>The Treasure</h2><p>Early twentieth century novel from the Swedish author and first woman writer to win the Nobel Prize for Literature.</p><p>Text: English, Swedish (translation)</p><h2>Reiver&#39;s Bride</h2><p>ABDUCTED HEIRESS is Volume One in this quartet-series.

She has sold every manuscript she has written. More than twenty-five of her books are set in the English Regency period (1810-1820), others are set in fifteenth-century England and sixteenth-and eighteenth-century Scotland. Three are contemporary romances. Amanda lives with her husband and son in northern California.While out riding one evening, Anne Ellyson unexpectedly encounters some reivers, but even more surprising to Anne is finding her cousin Fiona's former fiance, Christopher "Kit" Chisholm, among the group. Almost two years ago Christopher disappeared, and soon after, his uncle Eustace took control of Kit's title, his lands, and his betrothed. Convinced that Kit is a much better choice of a husband for Fiona, Anne vows to do whatever she can to bring them together and help Kit reclaim his inheritance. The only problem is that the more involved with Kit Ann becomes, the more the difficult it is to imagine the wickedly handsome rogue marrying anyone other than herself! Scott creatively uses the complicated border politics between England and Scotland of the time in her fourth Secret Clan book, which features the same intriguing mix of romance, adventure, and a sprinkling of magic as the "wee folk" continue to play matchmaker with mortals. <i>John Charles</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

I&#x2019;m not sure which turns me on more. You don&#x2019;t think of British Jews, if you happen to know any -- and I didn&#x2019;t until Daniel Jacobs -- as world-class lovers, but he must be an exception, or it could be the antidepressants he takes, which not only keep the blues at bay, but orgasms too. In Daniel&#x2019;s case, for, oh, forty-five minutes, give or take a few. My friend Henderson calls him the Bionic Man.<br> That&#x2019;s how I&#x2019;d have begun this story if I&#x2019;d sat down to write it two months ago, instead of now. I&#x2019;d have put it firmly in the present tense, the intense present, a time that felt electric to me and that I know I don&#x2019;t want to part with yet. Two months ago, the story would have been all about the sweet madness and the math. And why not? When the numbers are in this range, you feel some obligation to history to keep a record. Remember that old Irving Wallace novel The Seven Minutes, about what goes through this woman&#x2019;s mind in the seven minutes of intercourse? Not one reviewer griped, Seven? That&#x2019;s it? Not one of them said, Irving, you sure this isn&#x2019;t autobiography?<br> Without my telling him, the doorman knows not to buzz me if packages, even groceries, arrive after he&#x2019;s seen dashing Daniel come upstairs. Phone messages on my machine pile up as thickly as pink While You Were Out slips impaled on an upright skewer. I always turn off the ringer on the phone and mute the voices on the machine, incoming and outgoing, so that we&#x2019;re not distracted. Or bombarded. My almost-ex sometimes calls, in tears, to say he wants me back, and my editor, practically in tears, to remind me that my novel based on the life of Lili Boulanger is budgeted for this year and I am eleven months late. And my other editor, a guy I call the Eighth Deadly Sin, who tries to tempt me to ghost another celebrity autobiography. He is a twenty-seven-year-old manic depressive with his own imprint who hired me to write the life story of a daytime TV personality, which I finished in three months and is about to be published without my name on it, thank God.<br> As book-writing goes, other people&#x2019;s autobiographies are child&#x2019;s play. You&#x2019;re handed the central character, the dramatic highs and lows, the bittersweet, inspirational ending, a deadline that leaves no room for writer&#x2019;s block, and money, real money. Enough to leave my husband, Will O&#x2019;Rourke, and dog Henry, move back to New York, and live for a while in this studio-with-alcove furnished sublet in Greenwich Village with two walk-in closets, galley kitchen, central air, and a look of Pier One exoticism on the cheap. An abundance of wicker, batik, cotton throw rugs, and bayberry-scented candles that I often light when Daniel leaves.<br> The other people I don&#x2019;t want disturbing us are my mother, whose memory is on the fritz, and who sometimes calls to ask how old I was when my father left, and my best gay friend, Henderson, whose messages I love, except when they&#x2019;re broadcast into the boudoir, as this one was on an overcast afternoon: Sophy, I trust you&#x2019;re not picking up the phone because you and Daniel are having one of those marathon sessions. Hi, lovebirds. Would you believe I lost the name of that guy who does interventions again? My birth father was absolutely blotto last night at Cose fan tutte, and my wicked stepmother and I have decided it&#x2019;s time to send in the Eighty-second Airborne. I hope this is a quickie, because I really need to talk to you before the sun goes down.&#x201d; Since I moved back to the city in March, my life often feels surreal and overloaded, like an electrical extension cord with too many attachments, on the verge of blowing a fuse. Henderson claims I&#x2019;m suffering from what Jack Kerouac called the great mad joy you feel on returning to New York City,&#x201d; though I think it&#x2019;s the generic great mad joy of jettisoning a tired old life for a shiny new one. Some days I&#x2019;m Gene Kelly doing his waterlogged soft-shoe and singin&#x2019; in the rain, happy again. On more difficult days, I&#x2019;m Dorothy, wide- eyed at the phantasm of Oz but terrified I&#x2019;ll never find my way home, or never have another home to find my way to. Being able to focus completely on Daniel for several hours at a stretch keeps me from going off the deep end. Or maybe -- maybe Daniel is the deep end, and we are a couple of ordinary junkies who don&#x2019;t even know we have a problem. You forget, being married, that sex can take up so many hours of the day.<br> A quickie in Daniel&#x2019;s book is half an hour, and never mind foreplay, never mind the nerves on the back of my neck, the world of whispering and slowness. Daniiel&#x2019;s cut-to-the-chase is an acquired taste, I know, but now that I&#x2019;ve got it, I&#x2019;m not sure I want to go back to the evolved, sensitive-guy approaccccch. When I told my best woman friend, Annabelle, that on my birthday Daniel and I were at it for forty-three minutes -- according to the digital clock on my microwave, which I can see in certain positions from the bed across the room -- Annabelle said, That&#x2019;s a very good birthday present, Sophy.&#x201d; Afterward he gave me another present, a framed gelatin print of a photo of my beautiful, sad-eyed Lili Boulanger he had an art dealer colleague in Paris track down, wrapped in wrinkled Pocahontas gift paper. Then we staggered to his house at the end of Waverly Street, stopping at Balducci&#x2019;s and Carvel to pick up dinner for his four Vietnamese orphans, Tran, Van, Vicki, and Cam, two boys and two girls.<br> Of course they&#x2019;re not really orphans, because Daniel is their legal father, but so far they have lost two mothers apiece, the Vietnamese women who bore them and Daniel&#x2019;s wife, Blair, who is, as it says on all those old tombstones, Not Dead Only Sleeping, in a nursing home on the North Fork of Long Island, with a spot-on view of a meadow, a salt marsh, and the daily sunrise, none of which she is ever likely to lay eyes on again.<br> Daniel explained all of this to me over coffee, days after I had moved back to the city and we met at the gay-lesbian-all-welcome AA meeting in the gay-lesbian-all-welcome neighborhood where we live. But by all welcome, they don&#x2019;t only mean boring straight people like Daniel and me; they mean cross-dressers, transsexuals, and a surprising number of people who haven&#x2019;t made up their minds. He and I ended up there separately and by accident, thinking it was nondenominational, but we stayed because, story for story, it&#x2019;s the best theater in New York, a darkly inspirational, Frank Capra-in-drag movie that could be called It&#x2019;s a Wonderful Life One Day at a Time. It&#x2019;s also a place where a man telling his life story can say, During that period, which went on for five years, I was so busy drinking -- I mean, honey, I was taking Ecstasy as a mood stabilizer -- that I forgot to meet men and have sex, which brings us to Fire Island,&#x201d; and seventy-five people will howl with sympathetic laughter.<br> Daniel and I innocently sat next to each other, and he invited me out after for coffee at Dean &amp; DeLuca on Eleventh Street. I was still thinking about the speaker at the meeting whose name was Robert S., and who wore a platinum pageboy wig and a chartreuse DKNY miniskirt and said to us, Girls&#x201d; -- though I was the only one in the room -- I am waiting for God to work her magic,&#x201d; and I suppose I was waiting myself. That&#x2019;s what made me ask Daniel, at the start of our first date -- as I began to take inventory of all the ways he appeared different from my gray-haired, salty-looking husband -- where he stood on God.<br> Off to the side,&#x201d; he answered, quite a way. But here I am, knee-deep in drunks who talk about the Almighty as if he lives next door. It&#x2019;s a lot for an Englishman to sign up for. We have a long tradition of drinking ourselves to death quietly and all alone. Then again, this wasn&#x2019;t my idea.&#x201d; Daniel had the look of a youthful Tom Wolfe, long-limbed, clean-shaven, wearing a suit I didn&#x2019;t know then was an Armani; and there was not a strand of gray in his fine brown hair. He might have been my age, mid-forties, or a few years younger.<br> Whose idea was it?&#x201d; My physician advised me three years ago that I&#x2019;d die in short order if I didn&#x2019;t quit. And what about you? Where do you stand on God?&#x201d; I said that for the first ten years I went to meetings, I had a difficult time overcoming my godless Unitarian upbringing, but in the last six months, I found myself leaning in another direction, dispensing with some of my skepticism. I wasn&#x2019;t a practicing Unitarian any longer, I told him; I considered myself lapsed. Trying that out for the first time, the lapsed.&#x201d; Daniel laughed out loud. But I wanted to play it for laughs; I was flirting like crazy. I hadn&#x2019;t slept with anyone but my husband for the ten years of our marriage, plus the two years before, and I wasn&#x2019;t leaving anything to chance.<br> And what&#x2019;s at the core of a lapsed Unitarian&#x2019;s belief system?&#x201d; he asked.<br> Nothing to speak of, so there&#x2019;s room for reconsideration, but not much motivation for it. What about you?&#x201d; I&#x2019;m Jewish,&#x201d; he said, but in the English style, sort of half a Jew, as if it were only one of your parents, and you&#x2019;re not certain whether to take it or leave it.&#x201d; What&#x2019;s the other half, in your case?&#x201d; Pure capitalist. I come from a long line of merchants. Fur and microchips. My great-grandfather was furrier to the czar. My father was the last furrier in London to move away from the East End when the Bangladeshis moved in. He went to Golders Green in 1962 and sold dead animals until the PETA people threw a can of fuchsia paint on my mother&#x2019;s full-length sable, which coincided roughly with the discovery of the microchip. He and my older brothers are computer consultants to the Queen. They have the lucrative gift of being able to endure long hours of bowing and scraping. I&#x2019;m the youngest of four sons and, some say, the family rebel. Instead of software, I peddle paintings.&#x201d; In AA, of course, you are not supposed to tell anyone your last name, but Daniel blithely told me his. I knew it from going to galleries during all the years I lived in New York and reading art reviews in the Times during all the years I didn&#x2019;t.<br> A cappuccino or two later, we were swapping infertility stories like girlfriends, by way of explaining how he ended up with four imports and I ended up with no offspring at all, except this gryphon-like dog Henry, whom I had left with my husband until I got settled. I didn&#x2019;t tell Daniel that night that Henry had been Will&#x2019;s present to me when I quit trying to get pregnant. I still carry around a picture of him, ugly as he is.&#x201d; Your husband?&#x201d; Daniel said, visibly startled.<br> The dog.&#x201d; And I didn&#x2019;t tell Daniel about the immense sadness that had made me stop trying to have a baby. It was our first date, after all, and I wanted him to think my past was safely behind me, buried like nuclear waste, in airtight containers, even though I&#x2019;d walked out on it only a handful of days earlier. Instead, I entertained Daniel with stories of my test-tube encounters with Green-Blue, the code name for the nuclear physicist at the California genius sperm bank I had wanted to be the father of my child, after it became clear that Will&#x2019;s sperm motility wasn&#x2019;t what it had been when he&#x2019;d fathered my two grown, soon-to-be-ex stepdaughters.<br> Green-Blue is six-one, IQ of one fifty-six, and the father, as of two years ago, of thirty-one children of lesbian mothers and straight single women scattered across the fault lines of Southern California. They Fed Exed me the stuff in tanks of liquid nitrogen. But I ovulate funny. It was like waiting for three cherries to come up on a slot machine. And my husband was convinced that the only sperm donor in the joint was the skaggy-looking guy who ran the business and called me at seven in the morning -- mind you, that&#x2019;s four A.M. in California -- to say, Sophy, I have to know, is your temperature going up or down?&#x2019;&#x201d; Daniel told me that he and Blair had done the temperature business, test tubes, and Pergonal injections. She had even made an appointment with a faith healer named Falling Rain Drop, who insisted they participate in a fertility dance in Washington Square Park every day at dawn for a week. Daniel refused.<br> The years of trying piled up, and Blair, pushing forty-three, grew impatient and fearful. In one fell swoop, they adopted three siblings, two boys and a girl, ages approximately six, four, and two, who had been living in an orphanage in Hoa Binh for six months, and a fourth child, Vicki, whose sad face in a photograph Blair could not resist. They nearly emptied out the orphanage and filled every room in the narrow, turn-of-the-century brownstone Blair had inherited from her stockbroker father.<br> Adopting all those children, you could say she was Mia Farrow minus Woody, and now, poor lamb, poor Blair, she is Sunny von Bulow minus the millions. Not that they are destitute; Daniel&#x2019;s two art galleries are doing record business, despite his long afternoon absences. He was a willing partner in the international quest for children, and he is a devoted father, though he is often sleep- deprived and frequently flummoxed, as when his five-year-old said to him, If you don&#x2019;t buy me a Beanie Baby, I&#x2019;ll say the F word all the time, starting right now.&#x201d; He wants me to think and seems to believe himself -- and it may be the truth -- that his essential nature is now subsumed by the condition of being overwhelmed. I used to have a personality,&#x201d; he will say, and a life I rather liked. Now I run an orphanage on a street where I am the only heterosexual man for ten blocks in every blinking direction.&#x201d; On the other hand, I&#x2019;m not sure what that personality was, the one he claims to have had. He can predict whether a client will prefer a Mir� etching to an obscure Delvaux oil painting, and he is consulted by museums and foreign governments to detect forgeries, but in matters of his heart, nuance is a rare commodity. When I asked him how his marriage had changed over the years, all he said was, Once the children arrived, we quit having sex on Saturday afternoons.&#x201d;<br><br>My friends are divided over the nature and severity of Daniel&#x2019;s affliction. Those who have spent time in England insist that his passport is his destiny, and his answer to my question about his marriage passes in that population for soul-searching. Other friends ascribe his limitations to gender. He sounds just like a man,&#x201d; Annabelle said, but worse.&#x201d; It may be most accurate on any continent to say that he is what Winston Churchill said about Russia: a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma.<br> But there is something else you should know about Daniel: I think he is still in love with Blair. She has this embalmed, waxy, forever-thirty-nine, Dick Clark quality. Perfect, silent, stricken, enveloped in the aura of her New York Stock Exchange pedigree and a life of excruciatingly good deeds. She founded and ran a literacy-and- reading center for inner city families and was always getting plaques and certificates from the mayor, the governor, Channel 7, the Amsterdam News, El Diario, and the Helen Keller Foundation. Daniel sells modern masters, wears Armani underwear, and a wristwatch as thin as a quarter, but his living room walls are now crammed with three-dollar pressed-wood plaques and ersatz diplomas from local TV news anchors who think Blair should have shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Nelson Mandela.<br> Poor thing was hit by a UPS truck the year before while bicycling on Hilton Head Island, where she was attending her only sister&#x2019;s wedding. Can Daniel marry again without divorcing his brain- dead wife? The subject has not come up between us. We are efficient communicators in the sack and above-average conversationalists on terra firma, but on the question of our future -- I mean anything beyond tomorrow -- we are neop...</p><h2>An Auctioneer&#39;s Lot</h2><p>This work presents heartwarming tales of a life in antiques from the star of BBC TV`s &#34;Bargain Hunt.&#34; From priceless eighteenth-century dining tables hidden away in decaying farm sheds to tattooed travellers with a penchant for Wedgewood china, professional auctioneer Philip Serrell has seen it all.

An extensive preface touches on the landscape, climate, and history of the culture (including helpful distinctions between Inuit, Native American, and Aleut peoples and descriptions of change up through the present), as well as the group's lifestyle and religion, noting how all of these elements influence the stories. Primary sources are quoted extensively not only in the preface but also in the "Expert Commentary" at the end of each tale. Magic, animals assuming human form, spirit helpers, wild Odyssean adventures (threats from huge caterpillars and giant clams, a giant whose breath can blow someone miles across the tundra), and great hunters all appear. The violence endemic to the tales is related straightforwardly, with no exploitive description. Throughout, the author's emphasis is on the relationship of the environment to the culture, and practices such as infanticide and women's roles are explained in terms of what was necessary for survival. The stippled pen-and-ink drawings are usually effective in conveying action and expression, but the style is ill suited to the introductory map, which fails to clearly convey its information. Though somewhat repetitive and scattershot in its reiteration of points, this collection is useful for its breadth of coverage and the cultural information. Howard Norman's The Girl Who Dreamed Only Geese: And Other Tales of the Far North (Harcourt, 1997), a more attractive collection, has different stories, from more recent Inuit tellers, and more concise context. The raw emotion and events of Wolfson's tales will appeal to a middle-school crowd, but the wilderness of divisions could be tricky.<br><i>Nancy Palmer, The Little School, Bellevue, WA</i><br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Tina and Harry Come to America: Tina Brown, Harry Evans, and the Uses of Power</h2><p>A provocative dual biography traces the high-profile careers and lives of Tina Brown, who shaped The New Yorker, Vanity Fair, and Talk, and Harry Evans, who ran Random House, as they transformed virtually every aspect of the American media until it turned on them. 50,000 first printing.</p><p><b>Judy Bachrach,</b> formerly a journalist for <i>The Washington Post</i> and a political columnist for the <i>Washington Star,</i> is now a contributing editor to <i>Vanity Fair.</i> She lives in Washington, D.C., with her husband and two children.The rise and downward slide of magazine editor Tina Brown (Vanity Fair, New Yorker, Talk) and husband, Harry Evans (former editor of the London Sunday Times and, later, president of Random House), goes under the microscope in Tina and Harry Come to America: Tina Brown, Harry Evans and the Uses of Power, which has been causing a stir in New York media circles, for whom stories of the media pair have long been catnip. For many readers, the real news in the book will be the account of the couple's earlier years in England rather than the familiar ground of their New York power struggles in the last decade. Vanity Fair contributing editor Judy Bachrach's book is well researched, but her determination to make the couple's story emblematic of contemporary media culture introduces a degree of editorializing. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>The Cold Blue Sky: A B-17 Gunner in World War Two</h2><p>As a waist gunner aboard Black Hawk, a B-17 Flying Fortress operating from bases in England, Sgt.

The illustrations are grouped by motif: The Early Work, Self-Portraits, Nudes, The People of Union Square, and The Walking Pictures. More than 70 excellent full-color reproductions capture the immediacy, luminosity, and Baroque grandeur of the paintings; and the black-and white reproductions of over 175 drawings and etchings reveal Bishop&#39;s extraordinarily masterful draftsmanship. Also included in this comprehensive monograph is an afterword by Linda Weintraub, director of the Edith C. Blum Art Institute, Bard College, that discusses Isabel Bishop&#39;s graphic work; a selected bibliography; and listings of exhibitions, collections, and awards and honors. Some of the most memorable, expressive, and satisfying images of American women are found in Isabel Bishop&#39;s art. Long recognized as an astute observer of life in and around New York&#39;s Union Square, Bishop, who died in 1988, has more recently been praised for her conspicuous empathy with women and her subtle depiction of timely - and timeless - feminine themes. John Russell, chief art critic of The New York Times, who has contributed an insightful foreword to the book, commented in a review in 1975 that Bishop &#34;has a novelist&#39;s eye for idiosyncracies of anatomy, dress and social behavior.&#34; Thus it is apropos that, in these pages, the life and artistic career of this compassionate chronicler of big-city life unfold through the insights of an author who is herself a novelist.</p><p>This multi-part work includes critic John Russell's generalized introduction, novelist Yglesias's 14-page essay based on seven interviews with Bishop before her death in February 1989, quotations from the artist accompanying works grouped by subject matter, and Linda Weintraub's art historical notes cataloging an exhibit of Bishop's drawings mounted by the Mid-Atlantic Arts Alliance. One of the first comprehensive looks at Bishop's works, this book uses some 175 illustrations, over 70 in color, to chart the progress of Bishop's painstaking oeuvre. In her own words, Bishop followed the old masters but offered an almost abstract conception of figures in motion. Not fully attuned to Bishop, Yglesias discounts Bishop's own statement that movement in her figures (and probably her whole complicated technique?) was "a metaphor of the possibility for social mobility in her subjects." Still, the book is recommended as a good introduction to Bishop.<br><i>- Mary Hamel-Schwulst, Goucher Coll., Md.</i><br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.Like her close friend Reginald Marsh, realist painter Isabel Bishop set down city street scenes in a quick, reportorial style. Her sketches and oils of working women from the 1930s and '40s can be read almost as a feminist statement. In her "Union Square" series and related vignettes of New York, Bishop, who died in 1988, captured odd or coarse facial expressions as well as the quiet dignity of ordinary people. Her self-portraits are striking, and her relaxed nudes, awash in color, are at once sensuous and ethereal. In an oil and tempera series of random, aloof walking figures done in the 1960s and '70s, Bishop integrates multiple points of view into one pictorial space, suggesting the terribly isolating tendencies of modern urban living. Novelist Yglesias has a sensitive eye in her sympathetic essay which pins down the artist's "piercingly loving" quality. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Furoshiki Fabric Wraps: Simple � Reusable � Beautiful</h2><p>The Pixeladies are sewing experts Deb Cashatt and Kris Sazaki.

Her humorous, lively tales and beautiful illustrations have become a natural part of childhood.A source of inspiration was the Lake District where she lived for the last thirty years of her life as a farmer and conservationist.</p><h2>Moon Odyssey (Space: 1999 #2)</h2><p>Novelisation of "Alpha Child", "The Last Sunset", "Voyager's Return" and "Another Time, Another Place". Rankine employs a much more conservative approach to the novel, with a faithful script-to-prose adaption of the four episode. Any linking of the four segments is minimal and does not alter events. Thankfully, no explanations are offered for the mysterious and mind-blowing events that the Alphans experience. Rankine's style is clean and fast-paced and, while maintaining character integrity, portrays the regulars as more down-to-earth, regular people in contrast to Tubb's �&#x192;¼ber-intelligent, more tension-ridden interpretation. Changes from established episodes are few and usually because they were present in the final shooting scripts and reflective of last-minute alterations: (1) Sue Crawford was originally named Cynthia Crawford. (2) Jarak and Rena's pursuers from home appeared in a fleet of six ships identical to theirs rather than one large warship. (3) the conclusion of the "biological clock" dialogue between Sandra Benes and Paul Morrow in "The Last Sunset" excised from the final print is restored (Sandra: "Do you know what sound I miss most in the silence of space?" Paul: "Birdsong?" and now, before the kiss, Sandra: "The sound of children".)</p><p></p><h2>Chronic Heartburn: Managing Acid Reflux and GERD Through Understanding, Diet and Lifestyle -- Includes More than 100 Recipes</h2><p><p> <i>44% of Americans experience heartburn and acid reflux on a regular basis.</i> </p><p> Acid reflux disease, or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), is a serious affliction affecting millions of Americans.

The Band?s members -- four Canadians: Robbie Robertson, Richard Manuel, Rick Danko, Garth Hudson, and a drummer from Arkansas, Levon Helm -- fashioned something magically new out of musically traditional components: old-time country and gospel, Preservation Hall jazz, medicine-show vaudeville. <br> <br>Starting out as a backing group for Ronnie Hawkins before being propelled onto the world stage by Bob Dylan, The Band retreated from the psychedelic circus of 60s? rock to produce two of the most revered albums of the era. Music from the Big Pink and The Band, were remarkable recordings which steered rock ?n? roll back to its funky rural roots.

Since 1930, they have been the world's messenger of modern architecture. Based in Chicago, the architectural photography firm has achieved an international reputation that extends far beyond its regional association, and has made them the photographers of choice for some of the greatest architects of our time. Coinciding with a major retrospective at the Chicago Historical Society, <i>Building Images: Seventy Years of Photography</i> at Hedrich Blessing chronicles the history of this groundbreaking firm with close to 150 dazzling shots of architectural and design masterpieces by such greats as Mies van der Rohe, Frank Lloyd Wright, Albert Kahn, Eliel Saarinen, Bruce Graham, and many more. Architectural historian and memoirist Tony Hiss contributes a lyrical, insightful essay on what makes the assiduous photographers of Hedrich Blessing rise above the rest. <i>Building Images</i> brings the majesty, nuance, and poetry of our era's great buildings to light with these indelible photographs.</p><p>Tony Hiss is the author of five previous books, including The Experience of Place and the much acclaimed From Alger&#39;s Window: A Son&#39;s Memoir. He is a leading figure in the emerging science of place and lives in New York City.Architecture poses many challenges for photographers, inspiring Ken Hedrich to make the pronouncement that became the motto for the firm he co-founded: "Don't make photographs, think them." Established in Chicago in 1929, Hedrich Blessing attracted the finest photographers and the most innovative and influential architects, ultimately amassing an immense and artistically superb archive of architectural photographs that is now housed at the Chicago Historical Society. This sumptuous volume, gracefully introduced by Hiss, presents the cream of the collection, the impeccable and often poetic work of 19 preeminent photographers who captured the form and spirit of buildings by such key architects as Holabird &amp; Root; Mies van der Rohe; Skidmore, Ownings &amp; Merrill; and Albert Kahn. From the spare to the opulent, from velvety black-and-white to color of astonishing delicacy, these gorgeous images bring out the essence of the structures they chronicle and explore the ways architecture defines the human landscape, and even vision itself. <i>Donna Seaman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

It depicts Hugh Blair, Alexander Carlyle, Adam Ferguson, John Home, and William Robertson as an intimate coterie that played a central role in the Scottish Enlightenment, seen here not only as an intellectual but as a cultural movement. These men were among the leaders in the University of Edinburgh, in the Moderate party in the Church of Scotland, and in Edinburgh's thriving clubs. They used their institutional influence and their books, plays, sermons, and pamphlets to promulgate the tenets of Moderatism, including polite Presbyterianism, Christian Stoicism, civic humanism, social and political conservatism, and the tolerant, cosmopolitan values of the international Enlightenment. Using a wide variety of sources and an interdisciplinary methodology, this collective biography portrays these "Moderate literati" as zealous activists for the cause in which they believed, ranging from support for a Scots militia, Ossian, and Roman Catholic relief to opposition to the Jacobite rebellion of 1745 and the American and French Revolutions.<br><br><strong></strong><strong><em>The Edinburgh Classic Editions</em></strong><strong> series publishes influential works from the archive in context for a contemporary audience.

Tracks the progress of a giant black cloud that comes towards Earth and sits in front of the sun, causing widespread panic and death. A select group of scientists and astronomers - including the dignified Astronomer Royal, the pipe smoking Dr Marlowe and the maverick, eccentric Professor Kingsly - engage in a mad race to understand and communicate with the cloud, battling against trigger happy politicians. In the pacy, engaging style of John Wyndham and John Christopher, with plenty of hard science thrown in to add to the chillingly credible premise (he manages to foretell Artificial Intelligence, Optical Character Recognition and Text-to-Speech converters), Hoyle carries you breathlessly through to its thrilling end.</p><p>Sir Fred Hoyle, F.R.S. (1915-2001), renowned astronomer, cosmologist, writer, broadcaster, and television personality, was born in Bingley, Yorkshire and educated at Bingley Grammar School and Emmanuel College, Cambridge. A Fellow of St John&#39;s College, Cambridge, he was a university lecturer in Mathematics before becoming Plumian Professor of Astronomy and Experimental Philosophy (1958-73) and Director of the Cambridge Institute of Theoretical Astronomy, which he founded (1967-73). In 1969 he was elected an associate member of the American National Academy of Science - the highest U.S. honour for non-American scientists. In 1974 he was awarded a Royal Medal by Her Majesty the Queen in recognition of his distinguished contributions to theoretical physics and cosmology and in 1997 shared the Crafoord Prize for his contribution to the understanding of the nuclear process in stars.

He gets his wish after a violent storm, some wicked Mexican weed, and a faulty compass cause his precious plane to crash on a remote tropical island.<br><br>When he hears Marilyn Monroe's breathless voice saying he's "kind of cute," Superman thinks he has woken up dead. Amelia Earhart is there too, noting the worst landing she has ever seen, while Jimmy Hoffa cooks up some fine chicken barbecue. They never died, you see. They just came here to escape their celebrity--invited guests, living out their lives in total privacy, all expenses paid, every need fulfilled. To Superman, it is heaven on earth.<br><br>Until he discovers the one little catch: he can never leave. . . .</p><p>Seventies folk-rock icon Ben "Superman" Willis may be at the height of his fame, but he's not having very much fun. The touring lifestyle has lost its luster, his marriage to a former Miss Southwest Louisiana is on the rocks, and his only real pleasure comes from flying his Beechcraft Baron twin-engine plane 9,000 feet above all his earthly obligations. One day, Superman's plane goes missing, thanks to a storm, a faulty compass, and some very strong dope. To the rest of the world, it's as if he has disappeared into thin air. In reality, he crash lands on a lush tropical island, where the first person he sees bears an uncanny resemblance to Marilyn Monroe. As he recuperates, he meets various other castaways: an elderly aviatrix who may or may not be Amelia Earhart; her cross-dressing putative copilot; elegant Princess Annie; and a barrel-chested barbecue chef named Jimmy--Hoffa, that is. Just like these famously dead and disappeared celebrities, Superman has found the one place that could fulfill his own secret wish: to fly so far away from his own life that he registers on no one's radar at all. <p> The author of wacky Southern bildungsromans such as <i>Tender</i> and <i>Crazy in Alabama</i>, Mark Childress branches out into new imaginative territory with <i>Gone for Good</i>, a novel with an all-star cast and a sprawling, slightly ramshackle plot. Superman's presence on the island unleashes some mighty odd goings-on, involving a power-mad islander the locals call <i>El Mago</i>, armies of mystically inclined monkeys, and a wizened native sage who produces gnomic utterances such as "Sometime is no why. Sometime just <i>is</i>." At times it seems that Childress's hero has escaped one adolescent male fantasy (rock &amp; roll stardom) only to fall into the arms of another: he gains magical powers, makes love to Marilyn Monroe, and engages in some highly entertaining monkey-wrenching against the island's would-be developers. Plus, everybody keeps telling him how important he is.

Yet we know nothing of the men who created it. John James, in this masterpiece of detection, shows how he came to identify the master masons from the stones themselves. His meticulous `reading&#39; of the cathedral has revealed much about those men: how they solved problems of engineering and design, how they raised two-ton stones forty metres into the air, and how one mason controlled over 300 men in this gigantic workshop. JOHN JAMES is an Australian architect. His first visit to Chartres, in 1969, led to a continuing passion for the early Gothic buildings of northern France, and he has been `reading their stones&#39; ever since.</p><p></p><h2>In Quest and Crisis: Emperor Joseph I and the Habsburg Monarchy (Central European Studies)</h2><p>The brief reign of Joseph I occupies an important place in Austrian history, coinciding as it does with the monarchy&#39;s great victories and conquests during the War of the Spanish Succession. Under Joseph&#39;s leadership, Austria established its long hegemony over Italy and suppressed the great Rgk6czi rebellion, drawing up a compromise with the Hungarian nation, which was to serve as a landmark in Austro-Hungarian relations until the end of the monarchy. Despite the significance of Joseph&#39;s contribution to the history of his dynasty, he has never had a modern biographer until now. Extensively researched both in published and archival sources, In Quest and Crisis is the first biography of this colorful emperor to appear in any language since the eighteenth century.</p><p>Charles W.

Donley Bannister, a West Texas horse trader, has killed a thug named Cletus Slocum, who stole one of Bannister&#x2019;s horses. Ranger Pickard is ordered to find and arrest Bannister and bring him to trial.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Bannister case turns out to be anything but routine. Pickard picks up Bannister&#x2019;s trail and finds him holed up with some cohorts who wound and vow to kill the young Ranger. Ironically, Bannister saves Pickard&#x2019;s life by fending off the would-be killers and taking Andy to a cow camp where his injury can be treated. When he is able to ride, Andy locates and trails Geneva Bannister, Donley&#x2019;s young wife, hoping she will lead him to the wanted man. The trail takes unexpected turns and detours: Near Fort Concho Andy&#x2019;s mission is interrupted by an ugly racial incident in which a black soldier is killed; Bannister is shot by outlaw Curly Tadlock and left for dead; and Tadlock brutally assaults Geneva. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Andy Pickard, newly married, still unsure of himself and his choice of Rangering as a career, must unravel this tangled series of events and accomplish his mission of bringing an accused killer to justice.</p></p><p>Elmer Kelton (1926-2009) was the award-winning author of more than forty novels, including <i>The Time It Never Rained</i>, <i>Texas Standoff</i> and <i>Hard Trail to Follow</i>. He grew up on a ranch near Crane, Texas, and earned a journalism degree from the University of Texas. His first novel, <i>Hot Iron</i>, was published in 1956. Among his awards have been seven Spurs from Western Writers of America and four Western Heritage awards from the National Cowboy Hall of Fame. His novel <i>The Good Old Boys</i> was made into a television film starring Tommy Lee Jones. In addition to his novels, Kelton worked as an agricultural journalist for 42 years, and served in the infantry in World War II. He died in 2009.CHAPTER 1 <br>Cletus Slocum stole Donley Bannister&#x2019;s best horse and crip�pled it. Now Slocum lay facedown in the dirt, as dead as he would ever be. <br>Bannister was known locally as a horse trader, .nding them in faraway places and bringing them to the West Texas hill country for sale. He could recognize a good horse as far as he could see it, and spot a blemish from .fty yards. He loved horses as other men might love a woman. The blue roan, he thought, was one of the best he had ever owned. <br>The four Slocum brothers&#x2014; three now that Cletus was gone&#x2014; also had a reputation for knowing good&nbsp; horses, steal�ing them when and where they could. They had gone unpun�ished because law of.cers had not been able to bring a strong case to court. It was dif.cult to persuade a witness to testify against one of them, knowing that to do so was to invite an unfriendly visit by the other three. <br>Bannister did not wait for the law to act. He pursued Cle�tus across the rockiest ground along the South Llano River. He caught up with him when the roan stumbled and went down, breaking a foreleg. While witness Willy Pegg trem�bled and begged for his own life, Bannister put an end to Cletus&#x2019;s dubious career. He felt no remorse over the man, but his heart was heavy with pain when he shot the crippled roan. <br>Riding back to Junction, he stopped at a modest frame house he shared with his wife Geneva. While he hastily gath�ered a few necessities for travel, he told her, &#x201c;I just killed Cletus Slocum. It was a fair .ght. You stay put here till I come back. Don&#x2019;t try to follow me.&#x201d; <br>Thoughtfully, he left her some money. Not so thought�fully, he neglected to kiss her good- bye before he rode away. Afterward, though she often thought about that oversight, he never did. <br>Andy Pickard stood in the open boxcar door, feeling through his boots the rumble of steel wheels against the rails. Wisps of coal smoke burned his eyes as he watched West Texas hills roll by at more than thirty miles an hour. He wished he were heading home. Instead, the train was carry ing him far�ther and farther from his new wife. <br>He sometimes wondered why he had decided to rejoin the Texas Rangers. There were less stressful ways to make a liv�ing. He had had more than enough of farming, walking all day behind a plow and a mule, taking verbal abuse from a cranky brother- in- law. He wanted to raise livestock, for that was something he could do on horse back, but a decent start in ranching required money. He did not yet have enough. Rangering seemed his best option for now. He regretted that it often took him too far and kept him too long away from Bethel. <br>He turned to a stall where his black horse stood tied, feet braced against the pull of the train&#x2019;s forward motion. He said, &#x201c;At least you&#x2019;re gettin&#x2019; to ride most of the way. Bannis�ter&#x2019;s horse had to take it all on foot.&#x201d; <br>The Ranger of.ce in Fort Worth had received a wire say�ing that Donley Bannister was seen in the West Texas rail�road town of Colorado City. Andy happened to be in Fort Worth to deliver a prisoner. He had been dispatched to ap�prehend Bannister and bring him back to stand trial for shoot�ing Cletus Slocum. <br>At least the disagreement had been about something worth�while, Andy thought. Too many men had been killed quarrel�ing over such trivial matters as whiskey, cards, or dance hall girls. A horse was a different matter. A good horse might well justify a righ teous killing. <br>Extension of rails across the state had given Ranger ef.�ciency a strong boost in these early 1880s. No matter how fast he traveled, a fugitive could not outrun the telegraph, and now he had to contend with the railroad as well. Rangers could put their horses on a train and cover distances in hours that would otherwise keep them in the saddle for days. They could move ahead of a .eeing suspect and cut him off or at least rush to wherever he had last been seen and shorten his lead. That was Andy&#x2019;s mission on this trip. <br>To the best of his knowledge, he had never seen Bannister. He had a physical description of the man, however, in the handwritten fugitive book he carried in his pocket: tall, husky, with pale gray eyes and a small scar on his left cheekbone where a mule had once kicked him. Probably a bit crazy too. A kick in the head could do that to a man, and nothing could kick harder than a mule. <br>The train chugged to a stop at a siding beside a tower upon which stood a large wooden water tank. Andy climbed down to stretch his aching legs and beheld the largest windmill he had ever seen. He judged its wheel to be twenty feet across, maybe twenty- .ve. Locomotive boilers required a lot of water to produce steam. The windmill, vital to the railroads, had also done much to open up large areas of West Texas for settlement by farmers and ranchers. They provided water where nature had neglected to do so. <br>He had recently placed a smaller mill over a hand- dug well on acreage he had bought in the hill country west of San Antonio. Someday, when he had saved enough, he planned to resign from the Rangers again, build a house beside the windmill and move there with Bethel. It was a good grass country for cattle, and several people had brought in sheep. Andy had no prejudice against woolies. They seemed to thrive so long as their own er could .ght off the wolves and coyotes and bobcats. These had a strong taste for lambs. <br>The thought of Bethel brought both warmth and pain. Sta�tioned in a Ranger camp near a former army post town, Fort McKavett, he had rented a small house at the edge of the settlement. There she was able to grow a garden and raise chickens. He had spent nights with her when he was not away on duty. He realized this was not the customary way for a young couple to begin married life. Too often he had to kiss her good- bye and&nbsp; ride away without knowing when he might return. Looking back, which he always did, he would see her small .gure standing there, waving, watching him until he was beyond sight. <br>He had warned her at the beginning that as a Ranger&#x2019;s wife she would spend many days and nights alone, waiting, wish�ing. But he wondered if she had fully understood how often she would have only a .ock of chickens and a brown dog for company. He even wondered if he should have put off mar�riage until he could provide her with a more stable home. But both had waited a long time already, almost beyond endurance. <br>He hoped he could capture the fugitive quickly and get back to her. A dispatch had indicated that Bannister could probably make a strong case for self- defense if he had stayed in Junction and faced trial. But he had chosen to run, so he was playing hell with Andy&#x2019;s married life. <br>The train&#x2019;s black- uniformed conductor walked down the line after seeing that the boiler was properly .lled. Pulling out his pocket watch and checking the time, he said, &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll be pullin&#x2019; out in a couple of minutes, Ranger. Ought to be in Colorado City in an hour.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Good,&#x201d; Andy said. &#x201c;The sooner there, the sooner I can get my business done and go home.&#x201d; <br>The conductor gave him a quizzical smile. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll bet you&#x2019;ve got a young wife waitin&#x2019; for you. That&#x2019;d account for your con�stipated look.&#x201d; <br>Andy&#x2019;s face warmed. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know it showed.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I know the signs from personal experience. Seems like I&#x2019;ve been married since I was six years old.&#x201d; <br>Andy asked, &#x201c;How do you handle it, bein&#x2019; away from home so much?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Home these days is what ever train I happen to be on.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t miss bein&#x2019; with your wife?&#x201d; <br>Thoughtfully the conductor said, &#x201c;Son, the .re burns hot when you .rst get married, but then it cools down. There&#x2019;s times you start feelin&#x2019; crowded. You look for a reason to get away for a while, and she&#x2019;s just as anxious to be shed of you.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It won&#x2019;t be that way for me and Bethel.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It will. Nature works it out like that to keep married couples from killin&#x2019; one another.&#x201d; The conductor frowned. &#x201c;You ain&#x2019;t told me, but I suspect you&#x2019;re after a man. Is he dan�gerous?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I just know that he&#x2019;s charged with murder.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Then he&#x2019;s dangerous. And you&#x2019;re .xin&#x2019; to tackle him by yourself?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s just one man.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;If I was you, and I had a young wife waitin&#x2019; for me, I&#x2019;d .nd a safer way to make a livin&#x2019;.&#x201d; <br>Bethel had not said much directly, but Andy had sensed that she felt as the conductor did. One of these days, when he could afford to buy more land and the livestock to put on it . . . <br>The train slowly picked up speed. Andy watched the tele�phone poles going by. A line had been strung alongside the tracks all the way from Fort Worth. It didn&#x2019;t seem logical to him that progress could advance much farther. Just about everything conceivable had already been invented. <br>Colorado City was mostly new, an offspring of the rail�road as it had advanced westward. When the boxcar was cen�tered in front of a loading chute, Andy led the black horse down the ramp to a water trough. A little Mexican packmule followed like a faithful dog. After both animals had drunk their .ll, Andy rode up the street toward the court house. It was customary for a Ranger to call upon local peace of.cers unless there was a reason not to, such as a suspicion that they were in league with the lawbreakers. That was not the case here. <br>Andy introduced himself to the sheriff, a middle- aged man with graying hair and an expanding waistline. The sheriff said, &#x201c;I got a call that you&#x2019;d be on the train. I thought they&#x2019;d send an older, more experienced man.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m old enough. What&#x2019;s the latest about Donley Bannis�ter?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Nothin&#x2019; much more than what I wired your captain. I got wind that he&#x2019;d spent time here playin&#x2019; poker and puttin&#x2019; away whiskey. Me and my deputy found his tracks and trailed him to the county line. That&#x2019;s as far as we had jurisdiction. I can take you to where we turned back.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d be much obliged.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I hope you&#x2019;re a good tracker.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Not especially.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Bannister don&#x2019;t seem to be tryin&#x2019; hard to cover his trail. He likely .gures he&#x2019;s already outrun whoever may be after him. I doubt he considered how hard it is to outrun a train.&#x201d; <br>Standing at a window, Andy let his gaze drift wishfully to a sign that said Restaurant. Where the elite eat. <br>He was not sure what elite meant. Schooling had been lim�ited by a tendency toward .ghting more than studying when other boys offered offense, which they often did. He had been taken by Indians when he was small and lived with them several years before being thrown back into the white world. Fellow students made fun of his Indian ways and his awk�ward attempt to relearn the language of his people. <br>Even yet, a Comanche word occasionally popped out of his mouth. Moreover, he sometimes had a .ash of sixth sense about situations and events beyond his sight. To the Indians, these were visions; to Andy, they were a mystery. He had no control over them. They came unbidden. Often when he would have welcomed one, it would not come at all. <br>He had such a hunch now about Bannister. He felt it likely that the man was no longer in a hurry, probably assuming he had traveled far enough to be safe. Otherwise he would not have tarried in this town to seek after plea sure. <br>The sheriff said, &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you walk over yonder and grab you some breakfast while I go saddle my horse?&#x201d; <br>Andy said, &#x201c;Suits me .ne. There wasn&#x2019;t anything to eat on the train.&#x201d; <br>The sheriff started to turn away, then stopped. &#x201c;See that dispeptic- lookin&#x2019; gent goin&#x2019; into the caf�? That&#x2019;s Luther Fleet. He&#x2019;s a tinhorn gambler. I heard that Bannister and him have done business together. He might tell you somethin&#x2019;.&#x201d; <br>Andy said, &#x201c;Thanks. I&#x2019;ll go talk to him.&#x201d; <br>Fleet sat at a table alone. Andy sized him up at a glance. Restless eyes and slick, long- .ngered hands told him this was not a man to whom he would trust his horse or even his dog. <br>Andy said, &#x201c;Mind if I sit down with you?&#x201d; <br>The answer was a growl. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s other tables.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;But you&#x2019;re sittin&#x2019; at this one, and I want to talk with you.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;If you&#x2019;re lookin&#x2019; for a game, it&#x2019;s a little early in the day.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m a Ranger.&#x201d; Andy touched the badge on his shirt, hand�made from a Mexican silver .ve- peso coin. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m lookin&#x2019; for a man named Donley Bannister. I hear you and him are friends.&#x201d; <br>The gambler&#x2019;s eyes .ashed a negative reaction. He said, &#x201c;Friend? Not hardly. Him and me have done a little business together. I always came out on the short end.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Do you know where he went when he left here?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;He didn&#x2019;t share his plans with me, and I didn&#x2019;t watch him leave town. He could&#x2019;ve gone north, south, east, or west. Maybe even straight up. Why don&#x2019;t you try straight up?&#x201d; <br>Andy moved in closer and noticed a small bruise on Fleet&#x2019;s left cheek. It looked fresh. He asked, &#x201c;By any chance, was that blue spot a gift from Bannister?&#x201d; <br>The gambler involuntarily brought his hand up to the bruise and .inched. &#x201c;He claimed I&#x2019;ve been owin&#x2019; him money.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Do you?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Go to hell.&#x201d; <br>The man&#x2019;s attitude was enough to sour Andy&#x2019;s appetite, strong though it was. He moved to another table and sat with his back to Fleet. <br>As Andy and the sheriff rode out from town, the lawman <br>asked, &#x201c;Did you have any luck?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d&#x2019;ve learned more talkin&#x2019; to a fence post.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Fleet&#x2019;s pretty good at .eecin&#x2019; cowboys and railroad hands, but he&#x2019;s not good enough to go up against the real profession�als. He&#x2019;ll welsh on the wrong one someday and get his lights blown out. I&#x2019;d volunteer to sing at his funeral.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I might be inclined to join you, if I could sing.&#x201d; <br>The tracks led north. The sheriff said, &#x201c;Ain&#x2019;t a lot in that direction, not for a long ways. Ranches and maybe a mus�tanger&#x2019;s camp or two. Hunters killed out the buffalo. Indians stay pretty much to the reservations anymore, where they be�long. There&#x2019;s no way of mixin&#x2019; the white race with the red. Too many differences.&#x201d; <br>Andy knew the differences all too well, for he had lived in both camps.

Perhaps the fugitive would become complacent and stop somewhere long enough for Andy to catch up.<br>Toward dusk he smelled wood smoke and spotted a chuck wagon camp a short distance ahead. He judged that it was about the time for a cowboy crew to be eating supper. He rode warily toward the .re, knowing the cook would object to dust being stirred up near his wagon.

Just a few of the questions asked and answered by Mrs. Elder in this her fourth edition of this splendid book are...which is the first Christian Church outside Jerusalem? Who took Christianity to the Isles? Who were the Druids and what did they teach? Who built the roads for the Roman chariots? In this most important work she disspells the erroneous belief that Britain was uncivilized compared with Rome and that the Druids were a mischievous sect. The work and teachings of this early British Church (Culdee) for 1100 years is detailed in this remarkable book. Although declared heretical by Rome in A.D. 705 the Culdee Church struggled on as distinct from the Romans until it was eclipsed by the Roman Catholic Church in the 12th century. Mrs. Elder states what is little known but of the greatest importance...the fact that Christianity as a Church was born in England before anywhere else and that England was a professed Christian country one hundred years before Rome and in fact when Rome was still persecuting Christians. She draws attention to the singular change without any opposition from Druidism to Christianity which was understandable in that fundamentally they had no great difference in belief. An interesting point is also made as to the difference between the British Church and the Church of England. The rise and establishment of Christianity in Britain has been dealt with by many writers but in these pages new light has been thrown on the origin of the Culdees with whom rests the introduction and with their successors the defense of the Apostolic Christianity brought by those early Christians to Britain shortly after the Ascension of our Lord.

They have inspired debate, dissent, war and revolution. They have enlightened, outraged, provoked and comforted. They have enriched lives - and destroyed them. Now Penguin brings you the works of the great thinkers, pioneers, radicals and visionaries whose ideas shook civilization and helped make us who we are. Voltaire&#39;s short, radical and iconoclastic essays on philosophical ideas from angels to idolatry, miracles to wickedness, make wry observations about human beliefs, and mock hypocrisy and extravagant piety - his call to his fellow men to act with reason and see through the lies they are fed by their leaders has provided inspiration to freethinkers everywhere.</p><p>Fran�ois-Marie Arouet, writing under the pseudonym Voltaire, was born in 1694 into a Parisian bourgeois family. He became notorious for lampoons on leading notables and was twice imprisoned in the Bastille. By his mid-thirties his literary activities precipitated a four-year exile in England where he won the praise of Swift and Pope for his political tracts. His publication, three years later in France, of Lettres philosophiques sur les Anglais (1733), an attack on French Church and State, forced him to flee again. For twenty years Voltaire lived mainly away from Paris. Among his best-known books are satirical tales such as Zadig (1747) and Candide (1759). He died in Paris in 1778.</p><h2>ST.

Even with the possibility of living 1,000 years, Chiyuki never seems self-serving, making her a delightfully conceived counterpart to Toya. The tone never becomes tragic, thanks to some nicely interspersed humor and the addition of the werewolf Satsuki. For years, fans longed for the conclusion to Millennium Snow, and with it now complete, Viz has reprinted the first two volumes in omnibus format. While the screentones are expertly employed to portray emotions, Bisco's pre-hiatus bishounen style is not yet fully developed, this includes some inconsistent facial proportions. By comparison, the final volumes show a marked improvement. This title has a tenderness to it that other vampire romances lack; it chooses to focus on the time people share together within their allotted lifespan. It is only by understanding and saving one another that Chiyuki and Toya can build a true bond and find eternal love.&#x2014;Rachel Forbes, Oakville Public Library, Ontario, Canada</p><h2>The Tears of my Soul: He Survived Cambodia&#39;s Killing Fields. His Family Didn&#39;t. Could He Forgive.</h2><p>Sokreaksa was a young member of a large family in Siemreap City, Cambodia. When the country feel to the Khmer Rouge on April 17, 1975, his family was forced to join the exodus to the jungle villages. As the young Khmer Rouge soldiers consolidated their grip, the deaths increased. Anyone who complained; anyone educated; anyone an informer disliked: all were &#34;sent to study&#34; - killed. Teenage boys were brainwashed into amoral, vindictive thugs. Finally the day dawned when the family was marched to a grave ready dug in a jungle clearing: one by one they fell as the hoes hacked down. Sokreaksa, gravely wounded, was covered by the bodies of his brothers and sisters. His executioners walked away laughing. That morning Sokreaksa climbed from the mass grave. Could he possibly forgive his family&#39;s killers</p><p>In 1977 at the age of 14, Sokreaksa &#34;Reaksa&#34; Himm saw 13 members of his family murdered by Khmer Rouge soldiers in the Killing Fields of Cambodia. Miraculously surviving the massacre, Reaksa swore revenge against the men responsible for the loss of his family. Years later, after surviving the horrors of refugee camps and roving death squads, Reaksa had a life-changing conversion to Christianity that gave him a whole new reason to seek the murderers: to forgive them. He is currently a missionary in Cambodia, where he builds schools, plants churches and trains leaders. Reaksa authored two books on the tragedy and his journey to forgiveness: The Tears of My Soul and After the Heavy Rain."For any one struggling to forgive wrongs done to them in this life, this book could be a real help. At 12 years of age, the author witnessed the brutal murders of most of his close family by the Khmer Rouge insanity in Cambodia. Only he and his sister survived. 13 did not. The Khmers thought they had killed him but he miraculously survived. This book is his incredible tale of God's provision for him to escape, find Christ and help in his years-long struggle with the desire for revenge upon those who killed his family.

In addition to her two major studies of Tesla (most recently <i>Tesla: Master of Lightning,</i> with Robert Uth), she has written <i>Midnight at Mabel's,</i> a biography of the great cabaret singer and song stylist Mabel Mercer. Cheney is also the author of <i>Meanwhile Farm</i> and <i>Why: The Serial Killer in America.</i> She lives in California.<b>Introduction</b> <p> Despite the flashy, dramatic, and often limelight attention that Nikola Tesla was given in the heyday of his reign in the fields of research and engineering, he maintained a very private personal life. Since he was a loner -- a perennial bachelor, working apart, not entering into corporate associations, and not mixing friends -- his personal life was obscure to outsiders. Such reclusiveness marking the career of one of the world's leading figures in science and engineering can pose severe analytical obstacles for a biographer. However, almost immediately after Tesla's death at the age of eighty-six in 1943, the biography <i>Prodigal Genius</i> appeared by John J. O'Neill, science editor of the New York <i>Herald Tribune.</i> For many years it stood as the only biography of Tesla, primarily because of the difficulty for any other would-be biographer to uncover significant additional information about him. </p><p> Following World War II, the tons of material representing Tesla's library were shipped to Belgrade, Yugoslavia, the country of his birth (Tesla was a U.S. citizen), where a state museum was established in his name. The circumstances surrounding the transfer of his estate to Yugoslavia are interesting but will not be commented upon here except to point out the problem of remoteness of such a museum for any biographer in this country, let alone the severe restrictions on access to archival materials that exist for researchers venturing to the museum. </p><p> In 1959, two rather short biographies of Tesla appeared. Dr. Helen Walter's book was intended for young people, and curiously contained illustration and frontispiece sketches quite unlike Tesla's appearance. Margaret Storm's book, published by herself and printed in green ink, was based on the assertion that Tesla was an embodiment of a superior being from the planet Venus! Another short biography intended for young people appeared in 1961 by Arthur Beckhard. Tesla's name was misspelled on the dust jacket (Tesla once wrote to a friend that he wished he could turn all the forked lightning in his laboratory on critics who misspell his name), and the book omits essentially everything on his life after 1900 (Tesla was then 44). All three authors leaned heavily on O'Neill's biography, as evidenced by the perpetuation of a number of erroneous legends that subsequent study has vitiated, and none of the three extended O'Neill's treatment. </p><p> <i>Lightning in His Hand: The Life Story of Nikola Tesla,</i> by Inez Hunt and Wanetta Draper, nearby residents of Colorado Springs, appeared in 1964, twenty years after O'Neill's biography. O'Neill did not venture to Colorado Springs, where Tesla established an experimental station in 1899 and conducted electrical experiments which to this very day amaze scientists the world over, and consequently did not benefit from information that could have been provided by residents of that city about Tesla's interactions with them. Tesla took on flesh and bones to some degree in Hunt and Draper's biography, and the book carried numerous photographs. Much of the focus of the book concerned Tesla's half-year stay in the Springs, which was the original intent of the authors. </p><p> Why should anyone actually wish to undertake another full biography after the appearance of O'Neill's <i>Prodigal Genius?</i> It has been considered the most authoritative biography extant, and probably was the best effort that could have been produced by anyone at that time, with the exception of Kenneth Swezey -- a science writer and Tesla's close personal friend during the last twenty-plus years of his life. However, from this vantage point of distance in time, O'Neill's biography is now seen to be weak insofar as it analyzed Tesla the man and thin with regard to his interactions with personal associates and friends. Even though O'Neill and Tesla were amicable, Tesla kept O'Neill at a distance, and O'Neill gleaned only what he was able to pry out of Tesla with great difficulty -- certainly not the most ideal liaison for a biographer. </p><p> Much information has surfaced since the appearance of O'Neill's biography, adding new dimensions to the extent of knowledge about Tesla. Many questions asked by students of his life have been answered; however, this unfolding has also presented many more mysteries. The Freedom of Information Acts revealed that the federal government had a great interest in Tesla's papers. Why shouldn't it? In the midst of World War II, and at press conferences, Tesla often startled reporters with talk of developing weapons with beams that would melt aircraft, telegeodynamics, and other advanced concepts. Whether real or speculative, the federal government took no chances. What became of these investigations by federal agencies is a story in itself. </p><p> In reviewing my own interest in Tesla, since high school days I was fascinated by his high frequency, high voltage researches for which he became world known. I was disturbed, however, by the inordinate difficulty in obtaining copies of his technical writings and, as well, identifying references to writings by others about Tesla's work. This prompted what was to become a project of many years -- that of producing an exhaustive catalog (published in 1979 as a bibliography and for which I served as co-editor) of the writings by and about Tesla and his work. In the course of pursuing studies in electrical engineering, and continuing interest in Tesla's high frequency, high voltage researches, my inquiries eventually led me to meet those who worked for him, such as his secretaries Dorothy Skerritt and Muriel Arbus, and laboratory technicians such as Walter Wilhelm. Along the way, his personal friends came into the picture as well as others who had known Tesla on a person-to-person basis. </p><p> As the Tesla Centennial (1956) approached, it became apparent that no observances were being arranged by the major scientific and engineering organizations in this country to signal the event. Together with Skerritt, Arbus, Wilhelm, and a number of other interested persons, therefore, I helped found the Tesla Society -- the function of which was to develop and coordinate activities for the centennial observance. Following the centennial year, the Society expired, but an awareness of Tesla's impact on society was regenerated in the hiatus since his death. An interest had been reawakened in the discoveries that he announced and demonstrated, but which had been retarded in development because of a technology lag in associated disciplines, such as material sciences. </p><p> <i>Inspiration</i> -- that is what he gave to other inventors whose endeavors his life spanned, and that is what his work continues to give to technical specialists in these times. On the occasion of Tesla's seventy-fifth birthday (1931), his contemporaries wrote that his lectures were then both as imaginative and inspirational to productive development as when they were first published forty years before that: </p><p> </p><blockquote>In almost every step of progress in electrical power engineering, as well as in radio, we can trace the spark of thought back to Nikola Tesla. There are few indeed who in their lifetime see realization of such a far-flung imagination. (E. F. W. Alexanderson) <p> In reading of Tesla's work one is constantly struck by his many suggestions which have anticipated later developments in the radio art. (Louis Cohen) </p><p> Prolific inventor, who solved the greatest problem in electrical engineering of his time, and gave to the world the polyphase motor and system of distribution, revolutionizing the power art and founding its phenomenal development. My contact as your assistant at the historic Columbia University high frequency lecture and afterward has left an indelible impression and inspiration which has influenced my life. (Gano Dunn) </p><p> You fanned into a never dying flame my latent interest in gaseous conduction. Early in 1894 I told our mutual friend that your book...which contains your original lectures, would still be considered a classic a hundred years hence. I have not changed my opinion. (D. McFarlan Moore) </p><p> I remember vividly the eagerness and fascination with which I read your account of the high tension experiments more than forty years ago. They were most original and daring: they opened up new vistas for exploration by thought and experiment. (W. H. Bragg)</p></blockquote> <p> There are three aspects of Tesla's work which particularly deserve our admiration: The importance of the achievements in themselves, as judged by their practical bearing; the logical clearness and purity of thought, with which the arguments are pursued and new results obtained; the vision and the inspiration, I should almost say the courage, of seeing remote things far ahead and so opening up new avenues to mankind. <i>(I. C. M. Brentano)</i> </p><p> Today, we yet find that the writings of Tesla retain their undiminished power of inspirational endeavor to the reader. Tesla was indeed <i>out of his time,</i> and this biography represents a distinct achievement in overcoming unusual investigative obstacles to bring his remarkable story to life. </p><p> Leland Anderson</p><p> Denver, Colorado </p><p> Copyright � 1981 by Margaret Cheney</p></p><h2>Classic Sermon Outlines: Over 100 Sermon Outlines by 3 of the Best Known Preachers of All Time</h2><p><p>This volume contains 105 model sermons, among the best ever written and delivered in the English language.

It has not been generally known that he was also a distinguished preacher. He began preaching at twenty-four years old and held pastorates until his death. The greatness of his sermons consists in their scriptural content, lucid presentation, practical application, and Christ-centeredness. <br>George Whitefield (1714-1770) was a dynamic English preacher who spent a number of years in America at the invitation of John and Charles Wesley. In his very first sermon, in his hometown, he preached with such fervor that a complaint was made to the bishop that he had driven fifteen people mad. Others may have been more learned, but none were more eloquent or more moving. J.C. Ryle claimed, "No preacher has ever retained his hold on his hearers so entirely as he did for thirty-four years." <br>Alexander Maclaren (1826-1910) has been known for generations as the "prince of preachers." He was born in Scotland and lived much of his life in England. His abilities to dissect a passage and to use analogies from nature and life have long been imitated.

A wonderful chronicle, the book to put next to Martin Duberman&#x2019;s Black Mountain: An Exploration in Community. Jonathon Williams Michael Rumaker&#x2019;s finely detailed, evocative memoir puts personal flesh on Black Mountain College&#x2019;s historical bones. He brings to life the daily texture of what it meant to live in that remarkable community. Martin Duberman Michael Rumaker seems to have forgotten nothing. The portraits of people I know myself are dead-on&#x2014;Fielding Dawson, Jonathon Williams, Robert Creeley, etc. And of course, Charles Olson, the Papa Whale himself. But the historical context is there as well, brilliantly. Best of all is Rumaker&#x2019;s self-portrait, indirectly presented, the best kind. A lovely (and valuable) book. Russell Banks An increasingly articulate record of &#x2018;those happy few&#x2019; who were its persons in the closing years of the college. The poet and rector Charles Olson makes an ample and defining pivot for the meld of stories here told&#x2014;of persons in displacing crisis, of elders confounded with responsibility and poverty, of the all too indifferent world surrounding this fragile company in perhaps the most decisive experiment ever to be attempted in the history of American educational enterprise. Robert Creeley</p><p>Michael Rumaker is an American author (born March 5, 1932 in Philadelphia, PA), to Michael Joseph and Winifred Marvel Rumaker. He is a graduate of Black Mountain College (1955) and Columbia University (1970). Most of Rumaker&#39;s fiction concerns his life as a gay man. His first book, The Butterfly, is a fictionalized memoir of his brief affair with a young Yoko Ono, published before Ono became famous. His short stories, Gringos and other stories, appeared in 1967. A revised and expanded version appeared in 1991. He began to write directly about his life as a gay man in the volumes A Day and a Night at the Baths (1979) and My First Satyrnalia (1981). The novel Pagan Days (1991) is told from the perspective of an eight-year old boy struggling to understand his gay self. Black Mountain Days, a memoir of his time at Black Mountain College, has a strong autobiographical element. In addition, there are portraits of many students, faculty, and visitors (especially the poets Robert Creeley and Charles Olson) during its last years, 1952-1956.</p><h2>Sing Me Back Home</h2><p>Recounts Haggard&#39;s rise to fame from his Dust Bowl beginnings through his detour to San Quentin and gives a scathing, behind-the-scenes account of the alcohol, drugs, sex, and money that makes the country-western world spin</p><p></p><h2>The Emperor and the Wolf : The Lives and Films of Akira Kurosawa and Toshiro Mifune</h2><p>Akira Kurosawa was the greatest of Japanese directors, acclaimed by Steven Spielberg as &#39;the pictorial Shakespeare of our time&#39;.

In this prequel to GINGER, a forlorn feline is coaxed inside by a little girl - and finds a new life as a beloved pet.</b><br><br>Once there was a little orange cat who was so scrawny that his tail was like a piece of string. He lived in a patch of weeds, and every night he had to scrounge for food to eat - until one day when, suddenly, everything changed. In this tender tale, Charlotte Voake&#x2019;s delicate, sprightly illustrations offer a glimpse of the star of GINGER as he first meets the little girl who earns his trust and takes him home.</p><p>Charlotte Voake is a highly acclaimed author and illustrator of books for children, including GINGER, for which she won the 1997 Smarties Book Prize Gold Award. She illustrated ELSIE PIDDOCK SKIPS IN HER SLEEP by Eleanor Farjeon and has been short-listed four times for the prestigious Kurt Maschler Award in Britain. Of her inspiration for GINGER FINDS A HOME, she says, "We had a cat who lived at the <br>bottom of our garden, and it was a great moment when he decided to come and live with us."*Starred Review* PreS-K. In <i>Ginger</i> (1997), a little gray kitten enters a household and gradually wins the acceptance of the established cat, Ginger. This takes place some years earlier, when Ginger is a scrawny young cat who drinks from puddles, eats from trash cans, and lives in a patch of weeds. A little girl puts out food for him and encourages him to come into her home and live with her. Unused to people and houses, he nervously runs away, but little by little, the skittish cat comes creeping back, to the child's great joy. The simple, good-hearted story will touch children as they identify with both Ginger's tentativeness and the little girl's longing. Accomplished with a lively, almost scruffy line, the ink-and-watercolor artwork captures equally well the body language of both Ginger and the girl. Neophyte picture-book artists who cram the pages with saturated colors and busy details have a lot to learn from Voake's economical approach, which makes it easy for young children to sense the characters' emotions and to care about the story's outcome. A fine choice for reading aloud, this satisfying picture book has immediate eye appeal and a story that children will want to hear again. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Newspapers proclaimed his genius in glowing personal profiles and quipped that &#x201c;the doctor has been called&#x201d; because the great man &#x201c;has not invented anything since breakfast.&#x201d; Starting with the first public demonstrations of the phonograph in 1878 and extending through the development of incandescent light, a power generation and distribution system to sustain it, and the first motion picture cameras&#x2014;all achievements more astonishing in their time than we can easily grasp today&#x2014;Edison&#x2019;s name became emblematic of all the wonder and promise of the emerging age of technological marvels.<br><br>But as Randall Stross makes clear in this critical biography of the man who is arguably the most globally famous of all Americans, Thomas Edison&#x2019;s greatest invention may have been his own celebrity. Edison was certainly a technical genius, but Stross excavates the man from layers of myth-making and separates his true achievements from his almost equally colossal failures. How much credit should Edison receive for the various inventions that have popularly been attributed to him&#x2014;and how many of them resulted from both the inspiration and the perspiration of his rivals and even his own assistants? How much of Edison&#x2019;s technical skill helped him overcome a lack of business acumen and feel for consumers&#x2019; wants and needs?<br><br>This bold reassessment of Edison&#x2019;s life and career answers these and many other important questions while telling the story of how he came upon his most famous inventions as a young man and spent the remainder of his long life trying to conjure similar success. We also meet his partners and competitors, presidents and entertainers, his close friend Henry Ford, the wives who competed with his work for his attention, and the children who tried to thrive in his shadow&#x2014;all providing a fuller view of Edison&#x2019;s life and times than has ever been offered before. The Wizard of Menlo Park reveals not only how Edison worked, but how he managed his own fame, becoming the first great celebrity of the modern age.</p><p>RANDALL STROSS is the author of five previous books, including <i>eBoys</i> and <i>Steve Jobs &amp; the Next Big Thing</i>.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i>In this entertaining biography, Stross (eBoys: The First Inside Account of Venture Capitalists at Work) approaches the life of Edison from an atypical angle: where scores of other biographers have focused on the genius's technical career, Stross presents Edison as the first self-conscious celebrity, a man deeply aware of the media's power and who wasn't afraid to use "the press's hunger for more sensational discoveries for his own ends." Though branding is now second-nature for famous people (and their handlers), Stross asserts that Edison launched the first successful branding campaign-an achievement arguably further ahead of its time than much of his technical output-by embracing the title "Wizard of Menlo Park," which was coined by a reporter during Edison's brief stay in that New Jersey town. With preternatural skill in image-management, Edison became indistinguishable from his moniker, encapsulating perfectly the air of mystery and wisdom he cultivated throughout his life, for both himself and his "invention factory," which "seemed capable of mastering anything." Stross's clear-eyed biography will show readers why, even at the end of the 20th century, Edison remains, outside the U.S., the best-known American ever. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Timothy Egan's page-turning account vividly recreates the rough-and-tumble days of Spokane and Eastern Washington during the Depression, as it tracks an unfolding murder and a half-century effort to conceal the truth.</p></p><p>Timothy Egan is a Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning reporter, a New York Times columnist, a winner of the Andrew Carnegie Medal for excellence in non-fiction, and the author of seven books, most recently Short Nights of the Shadow Catcher. His previous books include The Worst Hard Time, which won a National Book Award, and the national bestseller The Big Burn. A third-generation westerner, he lives in Seattle.Powerhouse story of an iconoclastic sheriff who cracked through 54 years of police coverups and solved the oldest open murder case in the country. Beginning with a brilliant evocation of 1935 Spokane and Pend Oreille County, Egan (Seattle bureau chief of The New York Times; The Good Rain, 1990) sets the scene for the killing of Spokane town marshal George Conniff, who had surprised men stealing butter from the local creamery. In the fifth year of the Depression, Spokane was full of reluctant hobos--many of them farmers who had fled the dust bowls of the Midwest--living, hungry for food and work, in a Hooverville by the local rail yards. The Spokane police regularly extorted sex, food, and money from these ``vagrants'' and collected also from the bootleggers, saloons, whorehouses, Chinese lotteries, and opium dens in the ``Queen City of the Richest Empire in the Western Hemisphere.'' When a shortage doubled the price of butter, 6'3'' rock-fisted Detective Clyde Ralstin and his partner profitably robbed dairies until the night that Conniff was killed. Ralstin was fingered for the killing by fellow detective Charles Sonnabend, but Sonnabend was ordered by the brass to stop investigating, and Ralstin disappeared. Fifty-four years later, in 1989, 47-year-old Sheriff Anthony Bamonte--former logger, Vietnam vet, Spokane cop--was writing his master's thesis on the ten previous sheriffs of Pend Oreille County and discovered a 1955 deathbed statement by Sonnabend about the coverup. Bamonte began to probe the case and, amazingly, men and women in their 80s and 90s who had known Ralstin came forward. Egan's narration of Bamonte's methodical stalking, of the ring of paranoia tightening around Ralstin (living in a tiny Montana town and knowing of the hunt), and of murder refusing to stay buried after 54 years--all make for compulsive, white-knuckle reading. Egan rises into the Most Wanted group of true-crime writers with this smoothly told, exciting account. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Arcane credit derivative bets are now well into the tens of trillions. According to Charles R. Morris, the astronomical leverage at investment banks and their hedge fund and private equity clients virtually guarantees massive disruption in global markets.

Now, there are barely fifty thousand. Reconstruction funds have been slow to arrive in this part of the country, the government choosing to concentrate on the more densely populated coast. There is no central power grid, no running water besides the Yangtze River. But the streets are clear of rubble and the local "security council" has prevented any postwar outbreaks. The chairman of that council is Kwang Jingshu, a medical doctor who, despite his advanced age and wartime injuries, still manages to make house calls to all his patients.]<br><br> The first outbreak I saw was in a remote village that officially had no name. The residents called it "New Dachang," but this was more out of nostalgia than anything else. Their former home, "Old Dachang," had stood since the period of the Three Kingdoms, with farms and houses and even trees said to be centuries old. When the Three Gorges Dam was completed, and reservoir waters began to rise, much of Dachang had been disassembled, brick by brick, then rebuilt on higher ground. This New Dachang, however, was not a town anymore, but a "national historic museum." It must have been a heartbreaking irony for those poor peasants, to see their town saved but then only being able to visit it as a tourist. Maybe that is why some of them chose to name their newly constructed hamlet "New Dachang" to preserve some connection to their heritage, even if it was only in name. I personally didn't know that this other New Dachang existed, so you can imagine how confused I was when the call came in.<br><br> The hospital was quiet; it had been a slow night, even for the increasing number of drunk-driving accidents. Motorcycles were becoming very popular. We used to say that your Harley-Davidsons killed more young Chinese than all the GIs in the Korean War. That's why I was so grateful for a quiet shift. I was tired, my back and feet ached. I was on my way out to smoke a cigarette and watch the dawn when I heard my name being paged. The receptionist that night was new and couldn't quite understand the dialect. There had been an accident, or an illness. It was an emergency, that part was obvious, and could we please send help at once.<br><br> What could I say? The younger doctors, the kids who think medicine is just a way to pad their bank accounts, they certainly weren't going to go help some "nongmin" just for the sake of helping. I guess I'm still an old revolutionary at heart. "Our duty is to hold ourselves responsible to the people." Those words still mean something to me . . . and I tried to remember that as my Deer bounced and banged over dirt roads the government had promised but never quite gotten around to paving.<br><br> I had a devil of a time finding the place. Officially, it didn't exist and therefore wasn't on any map. I became lost several times and had to ask directions from locals who kept thinking I meant the museum town. I was in an impatient mood by the time I reached the small collection of hilltop homes. I remember thinking, This had better be damned serious. Once I saw their faces, I regretted my wish.<br><br> There were seven of them, all on cots, all barely conscious. The villagers had moved them into their new communal meeting hall. The walls and floor were bare cement. The air was cold and damp. Of course they're sick, I thought. I asked the villagers who had been taking care of these people. They said no one, it wasn't "safe." I noticed that the door had been locked from the outside. The villagers were clearly terrified. They cringed and whispered; some kept their distance and prayed. Their behavior made me angry, not at them, you understand, not as individuals, but what they represented about our country. After centuries of foreign oppression, exploitation, and humiliation, we were finally reclaiming our rightful place as humanity's middle kingdom. We were the world's richest and most dynamic superpower, masters of everything from outer space to cyber space. It was the dawn of what the world was finally acknowledging as "The Chinese Century" and yet so many of us still lived like these ignorant peasants, as stagnant and superstitious as the earliest Yangshao savages.<br><br> I was still lost in my grand, cultural criticism when I knelt to examine the first patient. She was running a high fever, forty degrees centigrade, and she was shivering violently. Barely coherent, she whimpered slightly when I tried to move her limbs. There was a wound in her right forearm, a bite mark. As I examined it more closely, I realized that it wasn't from an animal. The bite radius and teeth marks had to have come from a small, or possibly young, human being. Although I hypothesized this to be the source of the infection, the actual injury was surprisingly clean. I asked the villagers, again, who had been taking care of these people. Again, they told me no one. I knew this could not be true. The human mouth is packed with bacteria, even more so than the most unhygienic dog. If no one had cleaned this woman's wound, why wasn't it throbbing with infection?<br><br> I examined the six other patients. All showed similar symptoms, all had similar wounds on various parts of their bodies. I asked one man, the most lucid of the group, who or what had inflicted these injuries. He told me it had happened when they had tried to subdue "him."<br><br> "Who?" I asked.<br><br> I found "Patient Zero" behind the locked door of an abandoned house across town. He was twelve years old. His wrists and feet were bound with plastic packing twine. Although he'd rubbed off the skin around his bonds, there was no blood. There was also no blood on his other wounds, not on the gouges on his legs or arms, or from the large dry gap where his right big toe had been. He was writhing like an animal; a gag muffled his growls.<br><br> At first the villagers tried to hold me back. They warned me not to touch him, that he was "cursed." I shrugged them off and reached for my mask and gloves. The boy's skin was as cold and gray as the cement on which he lay. I could find neither his heartbeat nor his pulse. His eyes were wild, wide and sunken back in their sockets. They remained locked on me like a predatory beast. Throughout the examination he was inexplicably hostile, reaching for me with his bound hands and snapping at me through his gag.<br><br> His movements were so violent I had to call for two of the largest villagers to help me hold him down. Initially they wouldn't budge, cowering in the doorway like baby rabbits. I explained that there was no risk of infection if they used gloves and masks. When they shook their heads, I made it an order, even though I had no lawful authority to do so.<br><br> That was all it took. The two oxen knelt beside me. One held the boy's feet while the other grasped his hands. I tried to take a blood sample and instead extracted only brown, viscous matter. As I was withdrawing the needle, the boy began another bout of violent struggling.<br><br> One of my "orderlies," the one responsible for his arms, gave up trying to hold them and thought it might safer if he just braced them against the floor with his knees. But the boy jerked again and I heard his left arm snap. Jagged ends of both radius and ulna bones stabbed through his gray flesh. Although the boy didn't cry out, didn't even seem to notice, it was enough for both assistants to leap back and run from the room.<br><br> I instinctively retreated several paces myself. I am embarrassed to admit this; I have been a doctor for most of my adult life. I was trained and . . . you could even say "raised" by the People's Liberation Army. I've treated more than my share of combat injuries, faced my own death on more than one occasion, and now I was scared, truly scared, of this frail child.<br><br> The boy began to twist in my direction, his arm ripped completely free. Flesh and muscle tore from one another until there was nothing except the stump. His now free right arm, still tied to the severed left hand, dragged his body across the floor.<br><br> I hurried outside, locking the door behind me. I tried to compose myself, control my fear and shame. My voice still cracked as I asked the villagers how the boy had been infected. No one answered. I began to hear banging on the door, the boy's fist pounding weakly against the thin wood. It was all I could do not to jump at the sound. I prayed they would not notice the color draining from my face. I shouted, as much from fear as frustration, that I had to know what happened to this child.<br><br> A young woman came forward, maybe his mother. You could tell that she had been crying for days; her eyes were dry and deeply red. She admitted that it had happened when the boy and his father were "moon fishing," a term that describes diving for treasure among the sunken ruins of the Three Gorges Reservoir. With more than eleven hundred abandoned villages, towns, and even cities, there was always the hope of recovering something valuable. It was a very common practice in those days, and also very illegal. She explained that they weren't looting, that it was their own village, Old Dachang, and they were just trying to recover some heirlooms from the remaining houses that hadn't been moved. She repeated the point, and I had to interrupt her with promises not to inform the police. She finally explained that the boy came up crying with a bite mark on his foot. He didn't know what had happened, the water had been too dark and muddy. His father was never seen again.<br><br> I reached for my cell phone...</p><h2>The Brain Fog Fix: Reclaim Your Focus, Memory and Joy in Just 3 Weeks</h2><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A new epidemic is sweeping the country.

A feast of riches, this illustrated anthology spanning the years 1940-1947 includes prose by Max Ernst, Henry Miller, Andre Breton, Paul Bowles and William Carlos Williams; valuable, fresh essays on Marcel Duchamp, Fernand Leger, Federico Garcia Lorca, Yves Tanguy and Pavel Tchelitchew; and poems by e.e. cummings, Wallace Stevens and Lawrence Durrell, to name a few. As this roster suggests, View's scope went beyond surrealism, embracing many emigre talents who clustered in New York and reproducing artwork by Picasso, Miro, Brancusi, Chagall. Also here are Sartre on the nationalization of literature, Wallace Fowlie on existentialist theater, Paul Goodman on eros. View crackles with verve and originality. First serial to Vanity Fair. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.This is an anthology of work appearing in View , the influential avant-garde magazine devoted to the arts, literature, and ideas that was published between 1940 and 1947. Selections include fiction, prose, interviews, letters, and criticism of art and literature, often in a surrealist or existential vein, that were calculated to stimulate, shock, surprise, entertain, or provoke. Almost 50 years later, these selections retain their freshness and sense of discovery, thus contributing to our understanding of the cultural climate during the war years. Contributors include Marc Chagall, Jean-Paul Sartre, Max Ernst, William Carlos Williams, Vaslav Nijinsky, Man Ray, Henry Miller, and other American and European intellectuals.

In less than an hour, a woman could build a Franklin sand table using a silver penny, pane of window glass, hammer, and broom handle. This was to prove vital to the Continental Army during the Revolution.<br> <br>Victoria Ferris-Smythe, Empirical Philosophy: An American History, 1938<br> <br>A LITTLE MORE THAN five decades after Mrs. Cadwallader ended the Civil War, I was eighteen years old and lived in Guille&#x2019;s Run, Montana, with my mother, Maj. Emmaline Weekes, who served as our county philosopher. In her official capacity, Ma responded to all manner of accidents and natural disasters. The rest of the time, she earned a decent living doing the kind of dull, ordinary sigilry that was in constant demand&#x2014;short-haul passenger flights, koru glyphs for enlarging crops, simple smokecarving cures for asthma and pleurisy.<br> <br>Much as I would have liked to help her in the field, Mother only rarely gave me the chance. I had the typical male lack of philosophical aptitude and so instead of going on emergency calls, I did the work of a philosopher&#x2019;s son: I kept the books, ordered supplies, cooked, and stood night watches.<br> <br>On the night of April 6, 1917, I was engaged in the thrilling task of organizing handwritten invoices from the previous year when Mother stormed into the house at nine o&#x2019;clock, dripping wet from the rain.<br> <br>&#x201c;What kept you?&#x201d; I called.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t even start, Boober!&#x201d; she shouted. &#x201c;Those cattle were scattered clear across Teller&#x2019;s Nook. I must have put in four hundred miles trying to track down the last ones. Mr. Collins is going to be mad as hell when he gets the bill.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mother ran a towel over her face and graying hair. She&#x2019;d taken ten emergency calls over the previous fourteen hours&#x2014;a very busy day&#x2014;in the midst of terrible weather.<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s beef stew on the stove,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>Mother dished herself a bowl and collapsed in a chair. I&#x2019;d eaten hours before.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve heard the news, I expect?&#x201d; Mother said.<br> <br>I had. After months of prodding, President Wilson had convinced Congress to declare war on the German Empire. So now America, too, would be part of the fighting that had racked Europe since 1914.<br> <br>I&#x2019;d decided I wanted to join up the second I heard. The army or the navy; one was as good as the other. A uniform, a chance to see the world while fighting next to the boys I&#x2019;d grown up with, a real man&#x2019;s job.<br> <br>But I knew Mother was going to be a problem. She&#x2019;d spent three decades with the Rescue and Evacuation Department of the US Sigilry Corps, flying wounded and dying soldiers from the front lines back to the field hospitals. She&#x2019;d done tours of duty in the Franco-Prussian Intervention, the war with Cuba, the Philippine Insurrection, and the Hawaiian Rebellion. As a result, she tended not to approve of America involving itself in other people&#x2019;s wars. She wasn&#x2019;t going to like the idea of me enlisting.<br> <br>&#x201c;Is there any chance you could be called up?&#x201d; I asked, trying to position the conversation just so.<br> <br>&#x201c;Never,&#x201d; Mother said. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ll mobilize a few of the younger reservists and move more active-duty women overseas. But they&#x2019;re not going to call a sixty-year-old lady, even if my name is still on the lists. It would be an embarrassment. No, what I&#x2019;m worried about is when Wilson calls for a draft for the army.&#x201d;<br> <br>And there was my chance.<br> <br>I regretted it a little. If I&#x2019;d had my pick of careers, I would have done as Mother had and served with Rescue and Evac&#x2014;the best fliers in the world, saving lives instead of taking them. But that was impossible. R&amp;E was the Corps&#x2019; most elite unit. They&#x2019;d never commissioned a man. And while I was a fine hoverer for a boy, the least R&amp;E woman could fly circles around me. So, the army didn&#x2019;t seem a bad second choice.<br> <br>&#x201c;I spoke with the State Philosophical Office,&#x201d; Mother continued. &#x201c;They expect to get two draft exemptions for essential support personnel. One of those is for you.&#x201d;<br> <br>This was going wrong already. She must have spent months laying the groundwork for that.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, that&#x2019;s good to know,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;But what I was thinking is that Willard Gunch dropped by this afternoon. He and Jack are talking about riding into town, maybe on Monday. To sign up.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Absolutely not.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Roddy Hutch is going with them,&#x201d; I continued. &#x201c;Probably Eliot Newton, too. And&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No! How can you even think it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Mother, listen&#x2014;if you sign up, you get to choose. You don&#x2019;t have to go in the infantry.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s all of them that get blown to hell and flinders! In the cavalry and the artillery and the merchant marine. I could tell you stories about the burns on the sailors at Manila Bay that would make your teeth sweat.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Jesus, Ma! I&#x2019;m going to be the only man my age in Montana sitting at home. You joined the Corps when you were only thirteen years&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care if you&#x2019;re the last man in the world sitting at home! You&#x2019;re not going, and I&#x2019;m not discussing this.&#x201d; She swept up her bowl and spoon, went to her bedroom, and slammed the door.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>Midnight came and went. Outside, the rain picked up and battered at the shutters. I fixed myself a cold ham sandwich and sat glumly back down in our little laboratory behind the kitchen.<br> <br>Essential support personnel. I should have seen it coming. I should have rehearsed my speech better, with all its fine sentiments about duty and loyalty to one&#x2019;s friends and adventure. Maybe I would broach the idea of enlisting again tomorrow after Mother had had time to get used to it.<br> <br>I tried to set my feelings aside as I settled in to mix up a batch of silver chloride, which we used for stasis sigilry. It was a godsend for flying when you had to strap a sick or nervous passenger to your back&#x2014;draw a stasis sigil with powdered silver chloride on a client&#x2019;s chest and she went stiff as a corpse. No breathing, no bleeding, no experience of what was going on around her. Most important, she didn&#x2019;t try to help you hover by flapping her arms and throwing off your center of gravity. We were down to our last three tubes. I&#x2019;d already put an order in with Harnemon&#x2019;s Philosophical Supplies, America&#x2019;s finest purveyor of philosophical powders, but they needed a couple weeks to arrange a shipment to a place as remote as Guille&#x2019;s Run. I would have to mix up a batch of homemade stuff to last until their delivery arrived.<br> <br>I weighed out a measure of thin, feathery crystals of silver nitrate and dissolved it in a beaker of hot water. I stirred for several minutes until I had a colorless solution, then did a few calculations and poured in the appropriate amount of common table salt. A whitish precipitate formed, swirling like snow toward the bottom of the beaker. Over the next hour, I laboriously filtered out the solids, washed them, dried them over a flame, and measured the powder into tiny smoked-glass tubes, which I put safely away in their padded box.<br> <br>Then I kicked the powder cabinet shut.<br> <br>How did Ma think she was going to stop me if I decided to sign up? I was an adult; it wasn&#x2019;t as if I needed her permission. I could simply go. Tonight even. She could find any old philosopher to replace me.<br> <br>I needed advice. I needed my half sister Angela.<br> <br>I went back to the kitchen and pulled out my message board. It was quite a large model for the time, an eighteen-inch square of glass with a wooden frame, the underside of which was coated with silver leaf. I took a scoop of milled quartz&#x2014;highly refined sand&#x2014;and poured it onto the glass, then smoothed it with my board scraper. Using the four-beat rhythm that the sigil required, I traced Angela&#x2019;s personal glyph into the sand in the upper right-hand corner with my finger.<br> <br>Ma said no, I wrote in the sand. What nxt?<br> <br>I countersigned my own glyph in the opposite corner, drew the sigil to send, and wiped the sand level with the scraper. The same message would appear immediately on Angela&#x2019;s board the next time she set it to receive.<br> <br>(A perfectly reasonable person might ask why it should work at all&#x2014;why should the sand on a slab of glass two thousand miles away shift to form the same words I&#x2019;d just written? Well, philosophy warps the laws of probability. If you watched a million plates of sand for a million years, eventually the powder on one of them would slip a little and end up resembling the letter A. Philosophical energy just gives it a nudge in the right direction.)<br> <br>I drew sigils to bring up the conversation Angela and I had had during the afternoon.<br> <br>Hows she tking it? Angela had written.<br> <br>Dunno, I&#x2019;d replied. I havnt askd yet. She&#x2019;s prbly mad not to be joinng th fun.<br> <br>Don&#x2019;t joke abt tht! 4 wars was plenty. Talk lik that &amp; she might voluntr.<br> <br>Wht abt y? I&#x2019;d asked. Cld be philsphr draft.<br> <br>Nevr, Angela had said. If they do, I&#x2019;ll mov to Mexco.<br> <br>Snds warm. I&#x2019;ll vist.<br> <br>Sure, bt when are y vistng me here?<br> <br>I wished I could. Six months before, Angela had run off to New York City, where a friend had found her a job as an amanuensis handling the message boards at a bank. It shouldn&#x2019;t have been a surprise; Angela had entertained fantasies like that for years, one exotic locale after the next. But when she&#x2019;d actually left in the middle of the night with one of Mother&#x2019;s old duffels full of clothes and equipment, Ma and I had been stunned.<br> <br>Angela&#x2019;s departure had left Mother in a difficult spot. Angela had been Ma&#x2019;s field assistant, backing her up on difficult calls and taking care of the simpler ones herself, so that Mother wasn&#x2019;t exhausted by the end of the day. I was a poor substitute at best, a fact the State Philosophical Board had driven home a few weeks earlier by denying me credentials as an apprentice. They didn&#x2019;t mind if I tagged along from time to time, but, as they put it, We cannot find any precedent for permitting a man to serve as a state philosophical officer, even in a trainee capacity. Indeed, it seems unwise and inhumane, both for you and potential clients, to allow such a circumstance.<br> <br>Which meant Ma now did all the practical philosophy and I was nothing better than her housekeeper.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not the women&#x2019;s work you&#x2019;d hoped to be doing, is it?&#x201d; my best friend, Willard, had said on my last visit to Billings, twelve miles up the road. That conversation had turned into our first fistfight in years. (I&#x2019;d knocked out two of his teeth.) Willard was right, though. Something was going to have to change at home before I got in real trouble or Mother dropped dead from exhaustion.<br> <br>I tried to console myself by reading a few pages from my favorite book, Life and Death on San Juan Hill, the memoir of Lt. Col. Yvette Rodgers, who&#x2019;d commanded the first modern R&amp;E wing during the war in Cuba. Chapter eleven&#x2014;Lt. Col. Rodgers trying desperately to guide a wounded flier back to the landing field by message after sunset, the woman lost and running low on powder, when the Corps encampment comes under Spanish cannon fire. Rodgers has the clever idea to&#x2014;<br> <br>Out of the corner of my eye, I saw the sand shift on the message board, which I&#x2019;d left set to receive under Mother&#x2019;s glyph. It now read:<br> <br>TO: E Weekes<br> <br>FR: Montana Philosophical Office, Night Desk<br> <br>PRIORITY CALL. Respond immediately.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, come on!&#x201d; I muttered. I didn&#x2019;t want to haul Ma out of bed.<br> <br>Robert Weekes for E Weekes, I replied. Details, pls?<br> <br>Original request reads: &#x2018;RA, RA, RA fam,&#x2019; the State night desk answered. Unable to reach originator by board. Glyph matches for Klein, Evelyn. Address on record is rural home approx 1.8 miles north of Three Forks.<br> <br>That was a mess. So, someone had messaged an RA&#x2014;a request for assistance&#x2014;for an entire family and then had failed to reply to any follow-up messages. A sigilrist might do that right before she ran out to fetch the doctor. Or for a fire. Or as a prank. The State Office seemed confident of the location, but I&#x2019;d never heard of anything called Three Forks.<br> <br>Wht county is 3 Forks? I asked.<br> <br>Gallatin County. Best estimate of location: latitude N45� 53' 33", longitude W111� 33' 8".<br> <br>I pulled out a sheaf of topographical maps and found the spot&#x2014;175 miles away, well outside Mother&#x2019;s usual area of responsibility.<br> <br>I wrote: Confrm: to Emmaline Weekes?<br> <br>Y. No closer CP avail. Tell E sorry from us, Robert.<br> <br>&#x201c;Son of a bitch!&#x201d; I said. Mother was going to have to cover it and it was going to take the rest of the night. On top of that, she&#x2019;d be flying in the middle of a rainstorm with only the sketchiest information.<br> <br>Acknowledged and accepted for E Weekes at 2:48, I wrote.<br> <br>I rapped on her bedroom door. &#x201c;Mother!&#x201d; I called. Nothing. I opened the door and shouted her name. She continued snoring. &#x201c;Flight for you, Major!&#x201d;<br> <br>Without entirely waking, Mother lurched out of bed, wrapped her bathrobe around herself, and shuffled into the kitchen.<br> <br>&#x201c;Did you say something?&#x201d; she asked.<br> <br>I ran back through the messages for her. Ma shook her head in disgust. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m supposed to be at the construction site for the hotel in Billings at six! If I&#x2019;m lucky, I&#x2019;ll clear this in time to be a couple hours late.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mother was fully awake now and copying the coordinates down. She spread out the large-format Montana topo map on the desk and began lining up a course. &#x201c;Squeeze through the pass and sight from the church steeple in Bozeman. Roughly west-northwest.&#x201d; She had a straightedge and compass out and was using a cardboard slide rule to determine flight times and powder expenditure. She stopped and gave me an irritated look.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, go get dressed!&#x201d; she said.<br> <br>&#x201c;I am dressed,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Put on your skysuit.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You want me to fly it?&#x201d; I asked, my voice rising an octave and a half.<br> <br>Mother didn&#x2019;t even look up from her charts. &#x201c;I need a navigator and a second pair of eyes. This is already a goat rodeo and it&#x2019;s going to get worse.&#x201d;</p><h2>Magruder&#39;s American Government: Texas Edition</h2><p>American government.

It only takes one to get you so hooked you'll read everything you can get your hands on, so take a couple of days off and give yourself room to binge on the brutal and hilarious Hank Thompson and Joe Pitt series, the blistering <em>Shotgun Rule</em>, and this latest and greatest stand-alone, <em>The Mystic Arts of Erasing All Signs of Death</em>. The best thing about reading a Huston novel is that you never see it coming--laughter, tears, the passing urge to vomit--everything is a surprise, creating a wholly unsettling and exciting reading experience. <em>The Mystic Arts of Erasing All Signs of Death</em> has all the makings of a perfect Charlie Huston novel--the down-but-not-out antihero, the outrageous supporting characters (each of whom deserves their own spin-off), the very bad situation involving money and violence, and the hilariously inappropriate dialogue that is Huston's signature--but with one surprising addition, hope. It does little good to break down the plot of a book this bizarre and brilliant. You're just going to have to trust us (and our Guest Reviewer, Stephen King), and read it. --<em>Daphne Durham</em><br><br> <strong>Amazon Exclusive: Stephen King Reviews <em>The Mystic Arts of Erasing All Signs of Death</em></strong><br><br> <strong>Stephen King is the author of too many bestselling books to name here, but some of our favorites include: <em>Cell</em>, <em>The Stand</em>, <em>On Writing</em>, <em>The Shining</em>, and his epic <em>Dark Tower</em> series.

What sort of janitorial problems would such work entail? It turns out there are firms that specialize in those problems, and in the Weird Street world of Charlie Huston, a couple of these companies might even do battle over the smelly, maggoty spoils of war.</p> <p>&#x201c;Trauma scene and waste cleaning is a growth industry,&#x201d; remarks Po Sin, the owner/operator of Clean Team.

Also enter Jaime, her half-bright half-brother who imagines himself a Hollywood playa but can&#x2019;t get out of his own way. There are many things to love about Charlie Huston&#x2019;s fiction--he&#x2019;s a brilliant storyteller, and writes the best dialogue since George V. Higgins--but what pushes my personal happy-button is his morbid sense of humor and seemingly effortless ability to create scary/funny bad guys who make Beavis and Butthead look like Rhodes Scholars.</p> <p>There are a lot of those in this book, and several I-can&#x2019;t-believe-I-laughed-at-that scenes of grue (I can&#x2019;t even talk about the pipe-bomb thing, not on a family website), but the best thing about <em>Mystic Arts</em> is how decency and heroism rise to the top in spite of everyone&#x2019;s best efforts to crush them under heel.</p> <p>Web wanders from the nightmarish underworld of body clean-up into the equally nightmarish worlds of hijacking and smuggling; he endures cross, double-cross, and triple-cross; he pees his pants while trying to shield his girlfriend from a bullet. He&#x2019;s scared but never cowardly, down but never completely out. He is, in short, a guy worth watching.</p> <p>So&#x2019;s Charlie Huston. He&#x2019;s written several very good books (including the <em>Caught Stealing</em> trilogy and the Joe Pitt novels, which concern a PI who&#x2019;s also a vampire), but this is the first authentically great one, a runaway freight that feels like a combination of William Burroughs and James Ellroy. <em>Mystic Arts</em> is, however, fiercely original--very much its own thing.</p> <p>Besides, admit it: you&#x2019;ve always wanted to know how to get blood out of a deep-pile carpet.</p>Charlie Huston is the author of The Shotgun Rule, the Henry Thompson trilogy: Caught Stealing, Six Bad Things (an Edgar Award nominee), and A Dangerous Man, and the Joe Pitt novels: Already Dead, No Dominion, Half the Blood of Brooklyn, and Every Last Drop. He lives in Los Angeles with his wife, the actress Virginia Louise Smith. <br><br>www.pulpnoir.com</p><h2>Secret Agent Father (Secret Agent Father Series #1) (Steeple Hill Love Inspired Suspense #197)</h2><p><br><br><strong>He has a son?</strong><br><br>Although he's never met the boy who arrives on his doorstep, undercover DEA agent Alex McCade can't deny the truth.

Not everyone, however,&nbsp;agrees that Lucius Hostilius was murdered. Poison was apparently the means of death, but Lucius was terminally ill. It was only a matter of time. Although he hasn't any official investigative status, Corvinus can't resist doing a little amateur sleuthing. And he has barely begun when two other corpses turn up and he is formally on the case. Lucius had been suffering something of a personality change because of his illness, so there is no shortage of suspects among friends and family whom he had antagonized. But Corvinus goes up many a blind alley before arriving at the heart of the mystery. As we follow Marcus Corvinus, clue by clue, on his 10th case, we allow ourselves to be diverted by rumors of Meton&#x2019;s love life and by an authentic recipe for fish pickle sauce.</p><p>David Wishart is the author of the Marcus Corvinus Mystery series.<p>"A sinuous plot and robustly drawn characters, including an uppity slave and a formidable widow, all add piquancy to this stew of small-town misdemeanors."&nbsp; &#x2014;<i>Financial Times</i></p></p><h2>Brian Chippendale: If &#39;n Oof</h2><p>Brian Chippendale, drummer for the acclaimed and outrageously loud noise-rock duo Lightning Bolt and collaborator on Bj�rk's 2007 album, <i>Volta</i>, is an increasingly in-demand graphic novelist, one of those artists who draw because they're compelled to. This newest volume is a departure from his last work, <i>Maggots</i>, and from his first book, <i>Ninja</i>, which elicited the following assessment of the artist's style by Salon.com's Douglas Wolk: "Chippendale's howling hyperspeed attack on every page with his pen is the kind of manifestation of pure style that has more to do with the contemporary visual art scene than with traditional comics and their ideals of clarity and representation." If and Oof are a Laurel and Hardy-esque duo who suffer a series of misadventures amidst Chippendale's frenetic landscapes on their simple quest to just survive, eat, pay rent and avoid confrontation. Comedy and horror ensue in this fast-paced trip through Chippendale's unconscious. The artist's most accessible work to date, <i>If 'n Oof</i> is replete with the frenzied line work and concise, witty dialogue for which he has become known. This first release of all new material since 2005 is a must for Lightning Bolt fans and graphic-novel aficionados, and proves more than approachable to those new to Chippendale's oeuvre.</p><p>Starred Review. Creatures with flower faces, leering robot monsters, and a charming mouse-eared hero are all drawn in a splotchy, scribbly style that gives truth to a line that occurs early in this strange, rambling yet engrossing book: "Operation Dreamworld must be realized." Chippendale, also known for his participation in the noise band Lightning Bolt, has a singular imagination and uses well-defined and -paced single-panel pages that lead us forward. Unexpected settings fill the page with lines--a bathroom with many obsessively drawn tiles, a flying space-city, a black-on-black dreamscape--before emptying out into white. Then a character leads readers, page by page, through empty space to a door leading back into the hectic frenzy of lines. Wonderfully peculiar characters speak in a variety of voices; robotlike instructions are interrupted by colloquial musings ("I mean, everyone here has been super nice, the pool is great, the garden rules, but..."). All are delightfully strange and once you enter, you don't want to leave this odd and imaginative world with its pleasantly bumbling heroes, If and Oof, constantly waking from one dream only to find themselves in another.

Hardcover Book by Peter Vladimirov</p><p></p><h2>In Search of London</h2><p>H. V. Morton turns his traveler's intuition and his reporter's eye for detail to the city that has fascinated him since childhood&#x2014;London past, present, and timeless. He explores the City and the Temple, Covent Garden, SoHo, and all the "submerged villages beneath the flood of bricks and mortar," uncovering layer upon layer of London's history. Morton follows the thread of imagination back and forth across the city, tracing unforgettable scenes: the Emperor Claudius leading his war elephants across the Thames. . .the grisly executions at the Tower. . .the world of Shakespeare, Dickens, and Queen Victoria. . .and the shattered yet defiant city of the Blitz as well as the postwar London of "ruins and hatless crowds." Morton's quest for London's heart reveals how its daily life is rooted in a past that is closer and more familiar than we might think, making the book as informative, entertaining, and rich in human color today as when it was written fifty years ago.</p><p><b>Henry Vollam Morton</b> was born in 1892 near Manchester, England. He became an international celebrity by scooping the world's press in the sensational discovery of Tutankhamen's tomb in the early 1920s. His newfound fame subsequently led to a series of extraordinarily popular vignettes on English city and country life, which went on to sell millions of copies worldwide. He died in South Africa in 1979 at the age of eighty-six.&#34; &#39;The master of his genre, often imitated but never matched.

He asks how we came to this point, and he argues strenuously for Christian discipleship and public theology that take sides. In both critical and creative ways he advances the specific relevance of Christian messianic hope to today&#39;s thorniest political, economic, and ecological questions-including human rights, environmental rights, globalization, market capitalism, fundamentalisms, and Jewish-Christian relations-and the deeper values contested therein. In a world reeling between utopia and disaster, Moltmann here passionately and provacatively shows how Christian discipleship, through engagement and solidarity, can blaze a redemptive path.</p><p>Jrgen Moltmann is Emeritus Professor of Theology at the University of Tbingen, Germany.My previous volume of essays, History and the Triune God (1991), contained 'contributions to trinitarian theology'. My concern there was the Christian identity of theology. Here I am offering 'contributions on the public relevance of theology'. There is no Christian identity without public relevance, and no public relevance without theology's Christian identity, since for Christ's sake theology is kingdom-of-God theology, while on the other hand kingdom-of-God theology gets lost in the clouds of utopia unless it is based on the person and history of Christ, and unfolded out of the experiences of his Spirit. The title, God for a Secular Society, indicates my belief that there is an implicit theology of modern times---a theology always already existent, but not critically thought through---and that this demands an explicit public theology. Its subject alone necessarily makes Christian theology a theologia publica, public theology. It gets involved in the public affairs of society. It thinks about what is of general concern in the light of hope in Christ for the kingdom of God. It becomes political in the name of the poor and the marginalized in a given society. Remembrance of the crucified Christ makes it critical towards political religions and idolatries. It thinks critically about the religious and moral values of the societies in which it exists, and presents its reflections as a reasoned position. But it refuses to all into the modern trap of pluralism, where it is supposed to be reduced to its particular sphere an limited to its own religious society. Because today these restrictions to one's own particular reserve in Western multi-religious society can be felt everywhere, and are actually welcomed by certain church leaders and theologians, I hope that these contributions may demonstrate and reinforce the public relevance of theology. <p>The chapters in this book are based on lectures which I have given during the last six years, for the most part in secular institutions. In order to preserve the line of argument in the individual chapters, I have not eliminated every repetition. The occasions when the lectures were held, and in some cases the places of their first publication, are listed at the end of the book. This collection of essays does not as yet present the outline of a new public theology. They are only preliminary contributions to such an outline. But with them I should also like to repudiate the new lachrymosity of some theologians, who have fallen into the snare of self-pity. </p><p>I should like to end this preface to these contributions to an understanding of modernity by telling a little ironical story, which I have from Hans Mayer. </p><p>When the modern world was born, three good fairies came along, bringing their good wishes. The first of them wished the child individual liberty, the second wished it social justice, and the third prosperity. But then, on the evening of the same day, the wicked fairy turned up and pronounced: 'Only two of these three wishes can be fulfilled.' So the modern world of the West chose individual liberty and prosperity. The modern world of the East chose social justice and prosperity. But the philosophers and theologians---and this is my own addition to the story---chose for their ideal world individual liberty and social justice, and consequently never arrived at prosperity. ---from the Preface</p></p><h2>Draper Touch: The High Life &amp; High Style of Dorothy Draper</h2><p>Either a prospective client hears my ideas and has an attack of apoplexy or gives me carte blanche,&#34; Dorothy said.

Outlawed by his first kill at age fifteen, John Wesley Hardin assumed the life of an itinerant cattle drover, gambler, and exterminator of men.</p>??<p>His bloody trespass through Southern states ravaged by the American Civil War found him pursued by lynch mobs, bounty hunters and assassins. Hardin became the archetypal wanted man.</p>??<p>First published in 1896, <i>Gunfighter</i> is a unique, gripping evocation of an American frontier stalked by vengeance and sudden death. A true classic of outlaw literature, it not only stands as one of the first recorded confessionals of a serial killer, but also as a study and inadvertant indictment of the gun culture which stills holds sway in modern-day America.</p>?</p><p>Son of a Methodist preacher, John Wesley Hardin killed a man at age 15, thus beginning a murderous, fugitive existence. He was eventually caught, and during his 16 years in jail studied law. After his release, he set up a law practice, but soon returned to gambling and drinking. By the time of his death at the age of 42, he was killed in a barroom brawl he was loathed as a murderer and loved as a vigilante hero, in equal measure. He also left behind the eerily captivating Gunfighter, the only literate, first-person account of an outlaw that has emerged from the late 19th-century West.

Potshot overcame its rough reputation as a rendevous for old-time mountain men who lived off the land, thanks to a healthy infusion of new blood and even newer money. But when this Western idyll is threatened by a local gang - a 21st century posse of desert rats, misfits, drunks and scavengers - the local police seem powerless.</p><p>Maybe Spenser's driven all the bad guys out of Boston. Which is too bad because on his home ground, the tough and tender PI and Hawk, his trusty sidekick, don't need a gang of other guys to do their work. And the hired guns they round up to help them clean out a nest of ne'er-do-wells who have the desert town of Potshot, Arizona, terrified aren't nearly as amusing as, say, John Dortmunder's criminal colleagues in Donald Westlake's caper novels. <p> The thugs who populate the Dell, a scrubby little enclave just outside of town, have the locals in their pocket, which is why the pretty blonde who hires Spenser to find whoever killed her husband points him toward the Preacher, who rules the Dell and its denizens. But Spenser's not as certain as his client that Steve Buckman died at the Preacher's hands. As our hero and his ethnically diverse but politically incorrect henchmen (one gay shooter, one Latino, one black, one Native American--all that's missing is Annie Oakley) investigate, it turns out that Spenser's right, as usual. The action ranges from Las Vegas to L.A., Atlanta to New Mexico, but much of it is a humdrum travelogue as Spenser rounds up his gang from all over the country to take on the Preacher and his musclemen. While <i>Potshot</i> isn't one of Robert B. Parker's best, it's still not bad. The one or two lines devoted to introducing Spenser's backup buddies don't begin to do any of them justice, and there's a lot more description of the artillery the guys pack than usual. But they do fill up the white space, and when the action lags, there's always Susan's dirty talk, shopping jones, and dietary obsessions to divert the reader. There's a midlife crisis somewhere in this evergreen series that's just waiting to erupt. Whether it's Spenser's, Susan's, or Parker's, however, remains to be seen. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p>Six CDs, 6 hrs.<br>performance by Joe Mantegna<br><br>Boston P.I. Spenser returns ? heading west to the rich man's haven of Potshot, Arizona, a former mining town recently reborn as a paradise for Los Angeles millionaires looking for a place to escape the pressures of their high-flying lifestyles. When a band of modern-day mountain men, led by a charismatic individual known as The Preacher, takes over the town, even the local police are powerless to defend the residents in the face of the clever, dangerous gang. Spenser assembles a group of his own, including the redoubtable Hawk, to beat the gang at their own dangerous game and form the nucleus of a real police force to watch over the town when he's gone.</p><h2>Film Crazy: Interviews with Hollywood Legends</h2><p>A collection of interviews with many great figures of Hollywood&#39;s Golden Era from a respected Hollywood biographer offers revealing insights into such directors as Hitchcock and George Stevens and stars including Ida Lupino and future President Ronald Reagan. Reprint. 10,000 first printing.</p><p>Patrick McGilligan is the editor of the Popular Backstory series. A resident of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, he is also the author of several biographies on noted filmmakers George Cukor, Robert Altman, and Fritz Lang, the last of which was named a Notable Book of The Year by the New York Times."We often felt like angels of death," McGilligan says of himself and his assistants, when they met the screen legends interviewed in this book, for most of the aged luminaries were in their eighties at the time. They debriefed some of the greatest names in film history, such as Hitchcock, William Wellman, Dore Schary, Joel McCrea, and Ida Lupino, and they caught Ronald Reagan during the 1976 campaign. With a book like this one, great subjects make great reading. Take Raoul Walsh. He started out acting in silents because he could ride a horse. After apprenticing at D. W. Griffith's immortal knee, he directed some fine silent films (<i>The Thief of Baghdad</i>, <i>What Price Glory?</i>, <i>The Honor System</i>). When the talkies arrived, he directed Cagney, Bogart, and Flynn in classic he-man stuff. Or take Ida Lupino, more appreciated now than in her prime, who provides insight into the distaff side of Hollywood's golden age. Great subjects; great reading. Film history comes alive immediately and joyfully, perhaps even for the most casual film fans. <i>Mike Tribby</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

These forces include electricity, magnetism and the deeper reaches of touch, smell, taste and sound. Peter Redgrove presents evidence to suggest that not only individuals but the world as a whole stands to benefit from simple awareness. Presiding over this transition from unconscious to conscious experience is the symbolic presence of the Black Goddess, who may be traced in many guises from ancient to modern times - from tantric oracles and gnostic cults to Coleridge&#39;s poetry and Surrealist painting. The book blends the poetry of &#34;The White Goddess&#34; with the wide-ranging applications of &#34;Supernature&#34; to express this general need for more awareness. Peter Redgrove is a poet and co-author of &#34;The Wise Wound&#34;.</p><p></p><h2>How to Ride a Motorcycle: A Rider&#39;s Guide to Strategy, Safety and Skill Development</h2><p>A beginner&#39;s manual especially geared to the needs of entry-level riders, this book provides all the basic instruction necessary to become a motorcycle rider with an emphasis on the challenges faced by neophyte riders. Starting at neophyte level and evolving into a serious, intelligent expert, How to Ride a Motorcycle tells the reader how to be a motorcycle rider with a strong emphasis on safety and big-picture strategy (&#34;think about it this way&#34; as opposed to &#34;do this.&#34;)</p><p><p>As the author of <i>How to Ride a Motorcycle</i>, I think the best advice I could give to any new rider is if you&#x2019;re going to do it, do it all the way. Buy the best riding gear you can afford, and take the MSF (Motorcycle Safety Foundation)&nbsp;basic course. And plan on riding your bike all the time: for stress relief, for fun and recreation, for transportation, and for commuting. Spending a lot of time in the "motorcycle mindset" will make you a better, more skilled, and safer rider. Everyday riders know this. Weekend riders don&#x2019;t they have to relearn, every time they ride. Don't always start from square one.</p><p>Of all the motorcycles available on the market today, I think the biggest bang for the beginner buck is Suzuki&#x2019;s SV 650. It&#x2019;s versatile, lightweight, nimble, and quick, with plenty of power, but relatively easy to handle and control. They look good and used versions are fairly cheap. Most importantly, it&#x2019;s a "beginner" bike that you won&#x2019;t get bored of right away.<br><br>As a motorcycle safety expert, I&nbsp;have discovered that humor is a great way to reach at-risk riders, and I try to make that a part of my book. Nobody wants someone wagging a finger at them and telling them to slow down and be careful. Riders I coach become engaged when I speak their language and make them laugh. I&#x2019;ve found it helps to poke fun at mistakes and see the humor in them, rather than getting out the graphs and statistics right away. Motorcycle riding, above all else, is FUN. Riders learn more and retain better when the information is lighthearted, interesting, and meaningful to them personally, and I hope you will agree with that in the book.</p><p>Knowledge is a motorcycle rider's greatest ally, and skill development is a lifelong pursuit. The evolution of a motorcyclist is a series of mental barriers, breakthroughs, and plateaus. If you&#x2019;re struggling to perfect a certain strategy or technique, you&#x2019;re banging up against a mental barrier. If you keep working at it and learning more, you&#x2019;ll make a breakthrough and take your riding to a new level. But sometimes people get lazy and rest on their laurels after beating a mental barrier. They get to a point where they think there&#x2019;s nothing left they need to learn. They&#x2019;ve reached a plateau. It will happen several times during the lifetime of a motorcyclist. But the plateau is only an illusion. As I said before, if you&#x2019;re going to do it, do it all the way. True riding enthusiasts, instead of accepting the plateau, actively seek out new mental barriers to overcome, and ultimately make further breakthroughs in their riding and advance to the next level. They do this by trying different kinds of riding (dirt, track, touring, racing) or by adopting new riding styles (Code, Pridmore, et al.) There is no limit to how much you can learn about riding, no limit to the level of skill you can achieve.</p>Pat Hahn is the author of the best-selling book<i> Ride Hard, Ride Smart</i>.

At the heart of this collection of portraits is my desire to remind us that we were all equal, until our environment, circumstances or fate molded and weathered us into whom we have become. Los Angeles- and New York-based photographer Mark Laita completed Created Equal over the course of eight years; his poignant words reflect the striking polarizations found in his photographs. Presented as diptychs, the images explore social, economic and gender difference and similarity within the United States, emulating and updating the portraiture of Edward Curtis, August Sander and Richard Avedon.
